The following statements are REQUESTS of the user and are not
binding parts of the license agreement.  I just ask you to please
be kind and try to help me out by following this list.  It mostly
allows me to keep track of what works, what is wrong, and versions.
Thanks.

1.  Any bugs you find in the code, please notify me ASAP so they can
    be dealt with.
2.  Anyway you find to "better" the code in ways of speed or just
    ease of use, I would be interested in knowing.  Version 1.0 is
    my first time into slightly complex file usage, so there are
    probably better ways of doing it than I did.
3.  Any redistribution that contains derivative work, I would like to
    be contacted so I can link it up to the main site.
4.  Check back to the main site regularly for fixes to the code.
5.  Check the site if you get the code to work to make sure I have
    your code base listed as "workable".  If not, please contact me.
6.  If your CodeBase is not listed, don't contact me 100 times and
    ask me when it will work for your CodeBase.  Ask someone in your
    CodeBase community if they know of any ports.  I will get to it
    eventually, I just do not want to be bugged.
7.  Please do not ask me how to make additions to the code that is
    not released in new versions, or available through a patch.  I
    will try to answer your questions if you run into a snag about
    how the program works, but I will not walk you through how to
    add a new feature if you don't know what you are doing
8.  Do not contact me asking when this or that is going to be added.
    You can contact me with requested additions in the feature, but
    only 1 or 2 emails please, I don't want to be spammed by requests.

The below list are rights I give you that are not covered by the GPL
license (section 10.)  These rights I give cover redistribution in
MUD/MOO related codebases only.  If you are running something else, as
section 10 states, please contact me for more information over USAGE.

1.  You can include this program in any non pay to use **LEGAL**
    distribution of a CodeBase as long as you provide the source in the 
    distribution.
2.  You can intigrate this code into any non pay to use **LEGAL** Codebase 
    and distribute it that way as long as I am credited in your game.  If you 
    redistribute the code, you must also include the original source even if 
    it is already within the source of your game.  Lastly, you need to leave 
    the notice at top of the files intact if you intigrate the code into your
    code base.
3.  If you release your Codebase that includes this program in it, and your
    Codebase is pay to use, please contact me first because you will be in
    conflict with the GPL license if you make someone pay for the code.    
    
If you think you might be breaking part of the license, or wish to contact
me about something else, you can reach me at

                                               rafermand@home.net
If that email doesn't work, visit my website   www.rafermand.com
Or visit my mud Rafermand                      stormbringer.sysconn.com:3002

I thank you for reading this file, and hope you follow my requests so this
code can be useful for everyone.
