#DEITY
Filename		../deity/varl~
Name		Varl~
Description	Lord over the balance of nature, Varl seeks out followers who keep themselves
balanced and neutral as well.  He despises orcs for their corrupt and wicked
ways.  Their destruction of nature causes him to work even harder than he has to
in order to keep balance.  Varl accepts all classes who choose to worship him.
He is fond of all types of magic for the mana used in spells comes from nature
itself.  However, he does not discriminate against those who use brute force.
Otherwise the balance would be disrupted.  Loyal followers of Varl are imbued
with a protection from nature's greatest powers: cold and heat.  They are also
granted the sight of hidden and invisible things.
