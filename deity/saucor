Filename		../deity/saucor~
Name		Saucor~
Description	Saucor was once a mortal king, but was elevated to deity status for
reasons known only by the higher powers.  He is still a powerful
deity nonetheless.  The followers of Saucor are generally of good
alignment, and typically of at least some noble heritage.  Saucor
hates goblins with a passion, as they constantly terrorized him and
his kingdom before his ascension.
