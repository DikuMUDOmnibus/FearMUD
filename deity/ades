Description	Ades is the goddess of the ever going battle of war.  She loves killing
be it may through, swords and spears, or sizzling your enemy or
translocating them into the ocean.  She hates goodness with a fiery
passion, and loves to see hate and destruction.  Because of this,
she is fond of trolls and other monsters like them.  She loathes elves
for their wisdom and pure hearts.
