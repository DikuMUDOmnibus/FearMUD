#DEITY
Filename		../deity/rook~
Name		Rook~
Description	A lover of strategy, Rook prefers those mortals who can think quickly
on their feet and react intelligently to situations as they arise.  He
has a neutral outlook on life, and as a result welcomes all classes from
thief to paladin.  He prefers anyone willing to go out of their way to
rid Rafermand of the monsters of the realm, and is not afraid to die in
the process.  Due to his neutral alignment, thieves will find Rook to be
one of the more forgiving deities.  His worshippers, when they are
sufficently ingragiated with him, receive the ability to breath underwater,
the ability to fly with nary a though, and their sense increase so that
they can see the magical aura about objects.
