#DEITY
Filename		../deity/nicolai~
Name		Nicolai~
Description	Nicolai represents all that which is evil and unkind in the realms.  He
is a wizard of darkness, yet does not hesitate to bloody his dagger as
well.  All who wish to spread the word of evil and destruction are as
welcomed as Nicolai will allow, for he is so evil, tolerance is all he
will practice.  His heart is cold, and so are his followers' hearts.
Due to the general goodness of elves, Nicolai despises them with fervor,
preferring their dark brethren, the Drow.
