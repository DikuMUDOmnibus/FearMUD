Filename		../deity/althena~
Name		Althena~
Description	The goddess Althena, the goddess of life and death.  She doesn't lean
towards either side, but works in the ways of both good and bad.  She
favors the humans who also follow her ways, having potential for
either path, and never following a single path merely due to heredity.
She hates the trolls for their traditional evil, never contemplating
any other path.
