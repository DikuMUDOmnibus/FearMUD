Name		Kanage~
Description	Kanage is an ancient deity of battle and honor.  He leans towards the
side of Good, but accepts Neutrality just as well.  The followers of
Kanage are known for strength and courage.  Kanage looks down on those
who are cowards, and smiles upon a brave warrior who fights to the very
end.  The haughty and cowardly elves annoy Kanage, and he favors the
hardy Dwarven race over others.  It is said that favorites of Kanage are
granted enhanced perception for their servitude.
