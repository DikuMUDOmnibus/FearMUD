Description	Trian, the God of Creation, is a humbly good natured fellow.  He
likes to see Humans and Elves create new ideas for the good of 
their kinds.  He dislikes Orcs and Trolls because they cannot 
comprehend the term, "intelligence".  He likes to see magical spells
and inventions, and doesn't really like the idea of weapons.
