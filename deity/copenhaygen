#DEITY
Filename		../deity/copenhaygen~
Name		Copenhaygen~
Description	Copenhaygen is a more fun loving deity, and one that loves the finer sides 
of tobacco use...at least in the arena of smokeless tobacco. Copenhaygen 
loves a good fight, and he loves the sport of hunting, as long as the hunt 
is done with some morals and values. He does not believe in the needless 
or wasteful killing of animals. If one is to be killed, it should be made 
use of, and he loves the taste of wild game. Being a more laid back and 
easy going deity, he enjoys his beer, which goes hand in hand with 
'taking-it-easy'. Lastly, he hates a thief. Not the overrall trade of the 
thieves, but actual theft. Assassination and the like do not bother him, 
it's just the taking of what is not yours that bugs Cope.
