#DEITY
Filename		../deity/guran~
Name		Guran~
Description	Guran, the god of wildlife and nature, is temperamental in nature.  He
holds a deep concern with all mortals who take a sincere interest in
nautre and its creatures.  Since nature itself is neutrally aligned,
Guran also favors mortals of neutral alignment.  Typically, neutral
aligned bards, rangers, and druids accept Guran as their deity.
Lastly, Guran is also known to be the protector of the bears.  Those
who follow his ways are required to protect the bears or answer directly
to him.  Also, Guran has a strong dislike for kobolds and favors those
who slaughter the enemy.
