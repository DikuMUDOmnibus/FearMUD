Well, as you can probably tell if you're reading this, we've got a clan
board to post notes to now.  I'll be using it from time to time to keep
you all updated on the goings on concerning the clan, but feel free to post
notes here yourself on any subject you wish.  Hope you all enjoy this,
mayhap it'll get some use   =)

In the next pk arena, Kasdan should be a target that requires special attention.

It seems weapons that are in chests seem to repop at weapon size 0.  If
you get time could someone with identify confirm this.  Thanks.

Heh, lately I and many others have noticed that few members of
the Highwaymen seem to log on anymore. Where is everybody? :)
