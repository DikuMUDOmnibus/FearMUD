Yo yo yo.. This is our spiffy note board. I just put it in and it wasn't 
working. Now it is!! Anyways if you do something to the kingdom or want 
something done to the kingdom please post it here. Also if you have any 
suggestions or whatever put them here. Any complaints go here also. This 
is the all-purpose board for now. Later we will probably have seperate 
boards for shizz. Anyways this is the board. 

Changes,
1. There is now a chest west of here.  The one in this room is for
extracting equipment and such.  The one west of here is for scrolls
and the like.

2.  Forge is south.  Blacksmith is southwest.  Banker is 2w 1nw.

3.  There is another bed it is 2w 3nw.

Right now I think that is all.  If you have something to add please post it.

Thx,
Beknik Varck, Prince of Feii

Gentleman,

It is time for us to get some explosive growth out of our fair kingdom of Feii.
I believe we have more man-power than any other kingdom in the world, and that
is a tremendous advantage which me must leverage, if we want to come out on top.
Bek, you are in line for the next town, we are currently low 30's with our moral, and
cast 'wizardeye' will be making it to town size 5 within a few months.  Once we do, start a new town
wherever you deem fit.  Also as an option you can keep Trelaa if you'd like, but I suspect you want
a different place, in which case I will take it over.
These three towns Feii, Bek's town, Dar's town will be the main castles in the kingdom.
I want everyone to grow aggresively.  Keep your taxes low and your consumption at double.
Once you hit town size 5 (free town expansion), turn your expansion on, and branch off again.
This will snowball, and soon our only worries will be arguing about who has the best harem.
Long live Feii!
Long live Feii!
~
