Steel is in,south of the kingdom is a road,go west,into the plains,there will be mobs with armor of iron and bronze some with all iron and with one steel eq
when you first try to get steel,try to get them by themselves,flee and they spread out and attack one with steel,1v1..you might kill the mob

Hello all, Please do not remove trainers with out asking me. And we don't 
need more than one book seller of the same type (Strider). Plus they won't 
work in the same room it doesn't appear. There is now a banker in the room 
with the bed. All the way to the north and west is the novice book seller 
and in the room with the bed is the beginner book seller. If you people 
want more trainers get lumber and money. We are only allowed to put 2 
trainers per room so we need more rooms to get more trainers. Plus 
trainers are expensive 

Thx
