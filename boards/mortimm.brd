I've changed the Questmaster again.  As of right now, the Blade Staff
is the strongest legitimate weapon in the game.  Also, I plan on
holding a few mortal quests.  In fact, I'm starting one right now,
the first person to find three items with the keyword "Green" will
be rewarded.  Four items will recieve a better reward.  Each of these
items must be unique, as in no three "Green swords".  A "Green Sword",
"Green Axe", and "Green Lance" would be accepted.  Also, I announce
a new service I'll personally provide for a limited time.  100 qp
rename/rekeys.  This is far cheaper than planned in the future, so
if you wish to have something renamed, you have the advantage now.
This is partially due to the fact that the best items now may not be
the best later.
