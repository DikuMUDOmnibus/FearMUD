Welcome everyone to Vermisia, the capitol city of the glorious kingdom 
Arcadia. We hope you enjoy your stay here and become one of our many 
citizens. There are always plenty of well paying jobs within the kingdom, 
so you will never be bored. We have a wide variety of things to do. Just 
read our map to find where you wish to go. We hope you like everything we 
have to offer and one day become a member of the greatest kingdom of all 
time. We are also looking for people to run our other town within the 
kingdom. If you would like to run one, and think you have what it takes, 
here's what you can do: 

     Come up with half of the needed price to begin. The starting
price for a city is 600000 gold coins if you wish to pay for it with
just coins. Or you can come up with 10000 lumber, 10000 stone and
100000 coins if you wish to work it off. You can combine the stone
and lumber for 20000 of each, but still pay the 100000. The place
where the town will be is of your choosing, as also is the name. 
You just must verify where you would like the town so it does not
interfere with anything the kingdom already owns.

     Owning your own town has a few rules though, that will be written here:

1) The town will be protected during an attack by the Secret Army
     of the Rainbow Triangle. If you are not familiar with them,
     there isn't much to know aside from they are quite valuable.
     All you must do is notify us that you are being attacked,
     and we will rush to your aid.

2) You can purchase your own standing army of Rainbow Triangle
     members. They are yours and will be placed where you want
     them to be, and will not be moved unless you say so. The cost
     per soldier is a one time fee per soldier that comes fully
     equipped with the best equipment the Guild can produce. The
     prices go as follows:
          Rainbow Guild Fairy Warlord - 100,000 coins
          Rainbow Guild Fairy Battle Cleric - 150,000 coins
     These guards are yours and are permanent until killed.

3) There will be a 20% resource tax to the kingdom on anything you
     purchase or extract. This covers the cost for us to have you
     under Arcadia's flag. There is also a 10% sales tax, and a
     general kingdom population tax. You may create a population
     tax for your own town of whatever value you wish to balance
     the budget for your town and are welcome to change any values
     within the townvalue command.

4) All the kingdom politics will be handled by the Queen. That is
     the bottom line. As ruler of your own city, you needn't have
     to meddle in the affairs of the kingdom or other outside
     sources. The Queen knows what is best for the kingdom and will
     do what is always the best choice for the kingdom overall.
     If you have a problem, feel free to leave a note on the board
     of The Arcadia Post directed to her and Minister Jibble of
     the Rainbow Triangle. All will be handled from there.

That is all, and have a wonderful day within Arcadia's capitol!
Come back again! Don't be a stranger to Vermisia!

Due to the mass construction of our wonderous city, we can now sell 
apartments to those willing to live by themselves. You can have your very 
own permanent place in Vermisia where you can rest, store objects, or just 
pass the time away. All of these apartments will be located in the 
Vermisian Annex Housing District. I will explain the costs and benefits of 
purchasing an apartment within the city now. All apartments come with a 
door with a password only -you- will know. As long as you don't tell 
anyone, no one can go into your place. The initial costs just purchase the 
apartment, the name of the apartment, and any description for the 
apartment you wish. The costs are given in lumber and stone (for those of 
the working class) or just plain cash. 


The cost for the initial apartment is - 36k lumber, which amounts to 1 million coins.
This gets you all the above mentioned things.


Some extras you can add to your place are:

A private chest to store items. We only offer small chests at the moment,
but we can upgrade when the time comes. The cost for a small chest that
has a capacity of 50 pounds is:
4k lumber and 50k coins -OR- 200k coins.

Some furniture you can purchase, from decreasing to incresing regen rate:
Normal Chair:        1k lumber and 1k coins -OR- 35k coins
Comfortable Chair:   1k lumber and 3k coins -OR- 40k coins
Normal Bed:          3k lumber and 10k coins -OR- 100k coins
Comfortable Bed:     4k lumber and 35k coins -OR- 175k coins

Some sources of water (and slight food):
A Vermisian River Spring: 1k stone and 5k coins -OR- 30k coins
A big beautiful Fountain:  2k stone and 8k coins -OR- 55k coins

And to make it easier for those rich people out there,
You can purchase a fully decked out place for just:

47k lumber, 2k stone, and 90k coins -OR the low, low price of-
1.7 million coins! What a steal! Come get your place today!
