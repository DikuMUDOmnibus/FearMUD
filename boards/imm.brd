Well, I have put another board in here.  This time it will be used to
post any bugs that we come up with.  If you found a bug and want to
post a fix for it, just post it here.  I will have a list probablyin
a few hours.

Well, first person to respond, eh? Not bad.
Anyways, you have found that caste code bug, like I told you.
And I would like to be filled in on why IMC was not working a little
while ago. *wink*
I'll think of at least 800 before the day is up, I'll keep you posted
