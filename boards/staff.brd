Hmm... I thought I wrote a note about this the last time I was on...
but I guess I didn't.  Hehe, sorry, I've been busy ;).  Anyways, I saw
that you put Copen in charge of all the building stuff, and I have no
problem with that whatsoever.  But (yes, but), I was just wondering
what I should do now... well, besides watching over everyone below me.
Just wondering what my duties are.

Hey xerves can you make an mprog command (ex: mpzecho) that will
recho in every room in the zone the mpzecho originates in the reason
I say make it an mprog is that evil mortals might spam a whole zone
if it was a normal command.

Stealing. Would it be possible to make it so players cannot steal from
other players? Or make it like a lower % and only allow deadly players
to steal from other deadly players.

Xer,

alright, on the subject of new jobs, I don't know if it's been
suggested, or what, but blacksmithing/weaponsmithing would be
a great job to put in the game.


That's it, just a quick idea.

Ever dipping,

Harle had a great idea. A quiet command. It rems every message like
weather and channels while you have the quiet cmd on. That way you can
edit stuff in the buffer and reading gboard msgs.
