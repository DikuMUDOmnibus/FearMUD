Hi - 

Listen, I'm really sorry about writing that note about the spell.. 
I found out that the color codes of the message was so dark that my term
wasn't picking it up. I had changed black already, because usually thats the
one that causes me problems, but I didn't really think that dark naxy blue
would cause trouble as well.

Anyway, I should have checked it out more from this end before I bugged you
Imms.. Please accept my apology?
