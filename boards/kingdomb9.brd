Early on the morning of Wednesday April 17th, the Black Tower was assailed by
Halyon and a host of dwarves, it is believed Halyon used the power of his full
Dark steel rigged equipment to win this, and we will try to contact immortals.


We lost all troops and citizens present, and the Tower was taken by Hasasia.

Malthros and I fought hard to rid the Tower of the dwarves, and with many deaths and time we did.

The tower is now under our control, and we are rebuilding and coming back better then before. We are to raid Hasasia as soon as possible because he has no standing army.

After the Tower incident, Amen-Ra launched a massive counter-strike against Hasasia.

We hit two cities, and wiped out the populations of both.

Today, 2200 Iron Slabs and 190 Steel slabs sit in the town of Minal-Morgul
waiting to be forged into whatever is needed.  We had a few casualties,
but we have 4 well armed guards posted watching over our slabs and a cleric
that needs outfitted.  Check it out when you have a chance.  I also sold some
iron back to pay everyone involved for their hard work.  You need to come talk
to me Malthros about your pay.  Good work team.

Think you could put some of that food I extracted in kingdom so I can
put it in my town, it is out of food.  Also, I would recommend buying
a small box for this room to leave notes in or something, instead of
having to run back to Rolen to buy a few.  Thanks (Oh I won't be on a
lot today, I might be on tonight, but I will be on longer tommarow)

Minas Morgul has been a complete success, we are able to outfit troops faster then ever before.

However, hard times are ahead of us. This weekends plans for us to begin our invasion has again been haulted, but we will resume Tuesday.

I cant disclose where we are going to attack, or with how many due to security reasons, we have recieved reinforcements from Minas Morgul and we are in ever way prepared to crush our foes in any manner that is presented before us.

Sharp has achieved the rank of Squire, and there is also talk of other promotions waiting to be handed.

So far everyone has helped to make Amen Ra grow and prosper, and with that everyone will benefit.

We have grown above the standard, and are now a force to be reckoned with.

Scouting is going to become an issue, thus i need volunteers to extract any and all information from anyone about locations of Kingdoms and landmarks of importance.

We need to form a map for our own people so we may easily move from place to place swiftly, this also includes reinforcement waves in invasions.


We must *NOT* lose a foothold once we attack, but conquer it completely.

Monday, April 22. Malthros the Grey, Knight of Amen Ra has declared his 
true intent to All, he intends to work with Halyon and Halyon pass the 
crown to him, thus Malthros wishes to raise his own army and govern his 
own part of the world. 


Malthros has been demoted to Serf and expelled from Amen Ra, treason is heavily looked down upon and dealt with harshly. 

Though im sure we are all discouraged by this untimely event, we can pick up and move on better then before.
As you all know the pressing matter of traitors, spies. Or enemy informants.

If you have personal friendship ties with Malthros, that is understandable. But please do not let that get in the way of anything. A.e. leaking information.

I am confident the rest of you will hold strong and not give way to such nonsense and foolishness.


Malthros is to be attacked if he is found near any Amen Ra outposts, especially Minas Morgul.

What a shame, I wish I could of seen it coming to help purge him.  Did
he do any damage besides the assistance of Hasasia?  Anyway, we should
be very careful to keep watch over the steel lands and make sure they
do not open up an outpost there for some kind of counterattack, because
he knows our tricks now.  What a shame, I am sure he will get his own in
the end.

I recalled them, they were bugged and I don't think it is worth losing

Aqua has attacked and the largest war in the worlds history has occured, both our armies have been decimated, we are now on a race to rebuild our forces as quickly as possible.

As of now Minas Morgul has fallen under enemy hands, plans to avoid this see Nagash.

We have 3-4 days untill we are attacked again
But if we work hard and swiftly, we can have it so WE attack in 3-4 days

MASS COLLECT THE FOLLOWING

Iron/Steel for troops (Put it in safe places and posts notes on how much you collected if you want payment)

(STONE resource)
(IRON resource)
(Money with can be deposited in the caves)


This is not a drill, but a serious and most important note


Good luck !





If we win Arcadia will fall
And we will be the most powerful Kingdom
