As you may know, this is the Immortal Issue board.
Issues such as Higher immortals treating you unfairly, or lower
immortals doing "bad" things. As you may know, there is not much you
at your level can do about it, but other people can.
People such as Stakk or Sartan, because these two are in the Executive
council. The Executive council simply takes care of Immortal Issues,
such as flames, and suggestions.
If Stakk or Sartan think you are fit to be an executive, they will
induct you. Otherwise, don't ask. You will be chosen.
