Okay here is a Knight Quest. There are four parts to it. You must complete
them ALL to be Knighted. Here are the quests.

Find the vessel of darkness, keeper of even darker blades.
Unto this add the will of a mighty and cold force to temper the darkness.
Finally seek the unbreakable vein of a dragon.
When you have achieved these things, take them unto the eldest of the wyrms
and beseech a God's knighting.
~
