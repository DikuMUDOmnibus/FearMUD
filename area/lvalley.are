of record breaking antlers set atop his head. His lower body is covered 
with the tan hide of a deer, and built the same, but on a larger scale, 
being the same size as that of a bull's body.

&bR&za&by&zn&be is a short, somewhat more stocky looking 
elf. Her skin is covered with a mazelike network of 
swirling and jagged tattoos. She is extremely beautiful, 
and has a wild attraction about her. Her hair is long, 
reaching down to the point where the back of her legs just 
meets her posterior. Her eyes are an icy blue, and her skin 
is a dark nut brown. Her tattoos are black, and frame her 
curves well. Her muscles are rather prominent, but still 
have an elegant and definitely feminine air. Though she is 
only four feet and six inches tall, she carries herself as 
through she were a giant among men, but with all the grace 
of the daintiest house cat.

rayne blade sword~
&zT&bhe &zR&bayne &zB&blade was designed for superior blade 
control in close quarters. The blade is rather short, 
measure about eighteen inches long. The unique thing about 
the design of this sword is that the handle is the same 
length at the blade. This allows for ease of balancing 
during creation, but more importantly it provides better 
leverage for the weapon wielder during a fight while 
mainting the short blade for close quarters.

&BA&Bs you look at this &Bk&bnife you might wonder to 
&By&bourself what a &BC&bopenhaygen Knife is. Well, it is a 
knife &Bt&bhat was designed by &BC&bopenhaygen and 
originated a style of &Bb&blade shape, much akin to the 
&BB&bowie Knife. Now, more specifically about &Bt&bhis 
knife, it is not overly large, &Bh&baving a blade a mere 
four to &Bs&bix inches in length. The &Bm&betal structure 
is continuous &Bt&bhroughout the design, making the 
&Bk&bnife fully functional without a &Bh&bandle, which is 
normally &Bf&bashioned from two piece of &Bw&bood which are 
fixed to both &Bs&bides of the handle. The blade itself 
&Ba&blways has a single edge and a flat &Bb&back that 
tapers gradually to the &Bp&boint, but only starting that 
taper an &Bi&bnch or two from the point. The blade always 
has a &Bs&bpine that runs down the center line of the 
blade, for &Bs&btability of the point, and the back of 
&Bt&bhe blade has small notches, for decoration &Bo&bnly.

actuality nothing more than a doorway, but no door exists. Either the 
owner of the house doesn't care if anything or anyone comes and goes at 
will, or the owner is long since gone and the door has decayed and utterly 
disappeared. Above the doorframe some of the smaller roots have formed the 
words,"Nevon and Copenhaygen".

&G This is the main room of this house, which belongs to Nevon and 
Copenhaygen, the 'Duke Brothers' of Rafermand. This front room is 
apparently the den, and is quite large and nice. There are some chairs and 
couches available for resting on, and different copies of parchments 
containing news and the like are lying about the room. From the look of 
available entertainment in the room it would seem that the two immortals 
like to simply sit and relax in quiet and peace, with the occasional game 
of chess.

&RHow you can have a clan.
***From Rook's bio***
&Y1. &cAny clan leader MUST be an Avatar.  No exceptions.
&Y2. &cNobody may be inducted into a clan without their
   permission.  Breaking this rule will result in the
   clan being deleted.  So be careful who you give induction
   privelages.
&Y3. &cAbuse of clan privelages such as the clan channel,
   clan recall, etc. will result in those privelages not
   being such.
&Y4. &cJoining a clan for the purpose of PKing one person and
   then quitting the clan will not be permitted.  Such
   'clanhopping' will be dealt with harshly.
   If you want a Clan, have at least four people who want to
   start the clan with you and send the following information
   to rafermand@home.com

          --Clan Name
          --Type of Clan Requested (Order/Clan)
          --PK or Non-PK or Discretionary
          --Clan Motto (no profanity or suggestive mottos)
          --Clan Leader/Second/Third
          --Approximate Location of Clan Hall
          --Description of Four Rooms in Clan Hall
          --Five Objects Name/Short/Long/Wear (clan eq)
          --Clan Class Restriction (if any)
          --Clan Align Restriction (if any)

join elders~
&zSo you want to join The Elders Clan? HAH!
Here are the basic requirements before you even ask Nevon if you think
you are worthy enough to even be considered. 
&Y1. &WYou must have at least 1000 hours logged.
&Y2. &WYou must be either be a Knight or King
&Y3. &WYou must have killed the Sky Dragon, Drusus, and Thriller by doing
     so when Nevon is on and can watch you do so.
&Y4. &WYou must be a frequent player in the arena battles and decent at
     PKing.
&Y5. &WYou must be helpful to newbies.(Being in newbie council is a plus)

&zThose are the basic requirements. If you have any questions then ask only Nevon.
More information about this clan will be posted in this room and a gnote will be
posted when it is updated.

change align~
&wSo you want to change your alignment? Well Nevon can make this
possible but it is costly. It will cost you 15 million in gold and
you must remain that alignment for at least one month. You can only
ask Nevon to do this. Do NOT bother Xerves or any other Immortal to do
this because they won't. Anyway those are the rules as of this writing.

&ON&gevon's &Oa&gnd &OC&gopenhaygen's &OH&gouse~
&G North of here is Nevon's office, or, at least, it is the one availalbe 
to the general mortal public. East is a hallway which leads to the two 
immortals' kitchen and dining room. It also appears that the hallway 
circles around behind the hearth which heats this house in the colder 
winter months. South of here, mirroring the position of Nevon's office, is 
where Copenhaygen's office lies.

&G This is the den of Nevon and Copenhaygen's house. A staircase leads 
upstairs here, where the bathroom, bedrooms, and other personal areas of 
the two immortals' are located. North of here is Nevon's 'mortal- 
accessible' office, and mirroring it on the south side of the den is 
Copenhaygen's 'mortal- accessible' office. West is the doorway to their 
house.

hallway which appears to lead to the two immortals' kitchen and dining 
room as well as circle around their hearth. South of here appears to be 
Copenhaygen's office, at least, it is the one available to mortals. Anyone 
and everyone is, of course, welcome there.

&OC&gopenhaygen's &OP&gublic &OO&gffice~
&G This is Copenhaygen's office. There is a huge desk in front of the 
south wall, behind which is a massive office chair. That table and chair 
are both made of roots, and appear to be part of the house. One odd thing, 
since the chair is mounted firm in one position, how would Copenhaygen 
slide the chair closer to his desk so that he could reach everything he 
needed? Other than the desk and chair, bookshelves line the walls except 
for one small area of the west wall where there stands a fireplace.

&G This is a short hallway which leads around behind the hearth of this 
house, beside the kitchen, and then back to the den. The hearth is just to 
the south here, the fire emanating its radiance and heat. The fire itself 
is quite beautiful, the flames performing their quiet ballet. The kitchen 
is not much further to the east, and from what you can tell from here, 
there appears to be a large meal on the stove at this very moment.

is quite beautiful, the flames performing their quiet ballet. The kitchen

&OC&gopenhaygen's &OP&gublic &OO&gffice~
&G This room serves as Copenhaygen's Trophy Room. All about this room are 
hung the mounts of thousands of different creatures, not a single one the 
same as any other. All of these animals were killed by Copenhaygen with a 
longbow, impressive. A stained glass window is set in the east wall, 
allowing a multicolored light to filter into the room.

&OH&gallway &OA&ground &ON&gev &Oa&gnd &OC&gope's &OH&gearth~
&G Nevon and Copenhaygen's kitchen is just east of here, and the smell of 
a freshly cooked meal slowly drifts throughout the house, smelling very 
vibrant from this proximity to the source. The hearth, ever alive with 
flames, is southwest of here, and the hallway around it goes west and 
south from here. The hall itself is very plain, except that the entire 
internal and external structure of the house is made of above-ground tree 
roots and vines.

&G This is the hallway that goes around the hearth of Nev and Cope's 
house, also leading to their kitchen and dining room. The hearth is here 
just to the west. The walls of the hall are made of above-ground tree 
roots, looking very much like a log house with it's layered and stacked 
logs, except in this case it is actually roots. The main light in this 
area comes from the fire, though some is filtering in from the nearby 
rooms.

&G Nev and Cope's dining room is just east of here, where the table is set 
with a large centerpiece that holds about ten candles. There is a bay of 
windows in the east wall of the dining room, and the two places that are 
set are at the north and south sides of the table, which sets neither 
place as the head of the table. This hall goes north and west from here, 
circling the hearth.

&G This is the upstairs balcony of Nev and Cope's house. South lies the 
sleeping quarters, and related rooms, of Copenhaygen. North lies the same, 
except those rooms belong to Nevon. East of here is the upstairs bathroom. 
West, looking down from the balcony, the interesting, and almost eerie, 
den of Nev and Cope is visible. There is a hazy sort of dusk that fills 
the house, though the house itself is not exactly spooky, quite the 
opposite actually.

sleeping quarters, and related rooms, of Copenhaygen. North lies the same, 
except those rooms belong to Nevon. East of here is the upstairs bathroom. 
West, looking down from the balcony, the interesting, and almost eerie, 
den of Nev and Cope is visible. There is a hazy sort of dusk that fills 
the house, though the house itself is not exactly spooky, quite the 
opposite actually.

&G This is the end of the southern end of the balcony. Northeast lies the 
rest of the balcony, and west and east are Cope's private rooms. There are 
no doors, so the rooms are plainly visible. West appears to be Cope's 
bedroom, which is very large and rather plainly decorated, except for a 
large, very plush looking bed accompanied by an equally comfortable 
looking chair. East appears to be a simple closet.

&GThis is the upstairs balcony of Nev and Cope's house. This perfect
balcony was designed to hold an incredible amount of weight. Blessed
with holy magic, this balcony can take on the harshest weather and
will still keep its original beauty. A few birds and smaller animals
have made the edge of this balcony their pirch and even their home.

&ON&gev &Oa&gnd &OC&gope's &OB&gathroom~
&G This is Nev and Cope's bathroom. The bathroom itself is huge. South is 
a huge bathtub, and north is an equally large shower. There is a stained 
glass window in the east wall, which fills the room with an incandescent 
light with ruge overtones. A hazy air fills the room, giving a sense of 
limited visiblity, though it's simply some illusion of the stained glass.

&G This is where Copenhaygen's bed is. The large, brown, stained glass 
window is in the west wall here, and fills up most of that wall. South and 
north are walls, and southeast is Cope's easy chair. East of the chair, 
there is another room visible which appears to be a room with a small wash 
basin and a mirror. No doubt where Cope can take a quick face and hand 
wash before bed.

&G This is the shower in Nev and Cope's bathroom. The shower itself 
appears to work through a root which is severed and hangs down from the 
ceiling overhead. Since no knob is present, the water must poor on verbal 
command. The shower, like the tub to the south, is made of roots, and is 
water sealed by an oil that is secreted by the roots.

&G This is the large bathtub. The tub itself is made of roots, the same as 
the house, but the inside is smooth as glass, and it is polished and 
finished so that no splinters would inflict any pain. The outside of the 
tub is covered in an odd oil emitted by the roots which makes the tub 
waterproof.

&G This is the large 'play-pen' where Copenhaygen keeps his many pets. The 
set of rooms are rather plain, one small window set in the ceiling so that 
the pets can have light. In the center of the four rooms is positioned a 
food bowl, beside which lies a water bowl. Both of the bowls are large, 
very large. Obviously, he must have quite a few pets.

&G This is where Copenhaygen's easy chair is. There is a large, brown, 
stained glass window in the south wall, above the chair, which fills up 
most of the wall. This chair is, no doubt, here so that Cope can relax and 
read in peace without the constant comings and goings in his den since 
Nevon's and his house is open to the public at free will.

window that allows light with brown overtones to flow into the room during

down. Above the chair is a window exactly like the one above the bed.

&G This smaller section of forrest is made up of a very dense undergrowth 
which covers almost the entire section of wood. The leaves on the trees

&G The forrest thins slightly here, allowing for at least a little more 
visibility. Further east and north it appears there stands a house, though 
rather old it still seems to be in excellent condition. Unfortunately, 
that is all that can be said about the house from this distance. It is 
quite pleasant here though, what with the break in the foliage allowing 
for more light and sky to be visible.

&G The dense foliage breaks a little more, and almost becomes a clearing, 
except for all the briars and thorns which still cover the ground and rise 
in shrub-like form to roughly head-height. The house is quite visible now, 
made of logs, but tall and fine. It has stained glass windows, and vines 
grow up all sides, giving the house the appearance of sprouting straight 
up from the earth. Wait, that's exactly what has happened...the house is 
not made of logs, but of tree roots that have made impenetrable walls. All 
of this gives the house a strangely welcoming feeling, though not 
altogether peaceful.

&zA Cliffside Path~
&G Light pours into this room from above. At this point, at the top of the 
path into the "Lost Valley", it seems that the path down will be nothing 
more than a cave, however untrue it may be. North, East, and West, small 
amounts of light can be seen coming from those directions, albeit a minute 
amount. The ground here is rocky, and covered with small pebbles, 
threating to twist your ankle and send you stumbling. Now to choose, down 
into the "Lost Valley", or up to the safety of the tamed world.

&zA Cliffside Path~
&G This is the path down the east cliff. Light begins to fill this room 
now as the cave ends and opens up onto the cliff. Northeast, the path 
continues to slope gently down the cliff, slowly arriving at the Lost 
Valley. On the walls of the cliff, there are some small furry creatures 
scuttling about, as well as some odd looking little lizards. It seems that 
all the creatures in this area are indeed, previously, unknown.

&zA Cliffside Path~
&G This is the path down the west cliff. Here, the elevation is high 
enough above the floor of the Lost Valley that not much vegetation 
grows....if any at all. The path itself is fairly sandy, with small 
pebbles strewn about. So little vegetation is present that moss doesn't 
even grow in the damp shade in the rocks, however, there are many species 
of insects and a few animals scurrying about within view.

&zA Cliffside Path~
&G Further down this path can be seen the convergence of two paths, this 
one, and one coming from further west, though that meeting is still a good 
ways down the cliff. In the sand on the path are many small footprints, 
footprints that don't look quite like any footprint in the rest of the 
realm of Rafermand, but are still similar. For instance, one print looks 
to be that of a rabbit, except it is as large as a human footprint, and 
appears to have an extra toe that juts off the backside of the foot. How 
nice it would be to have that creature's hide!

&zA Path Down the Cliff~
&G Light begins to flood the room from the north as the cave entrance to 
the "Lost Valley" opens out onto a wide cliff. This path was cut into the 
cliff and goes straight north from here, sloping steeply. The "Lost 
Valley" itself can be seen in the distance to the north, stretching out 
for vast miles, and many new and strange species can seen either circling 
in the air, or running on the ground. This sight can not help but bring 
out the hunter in everyone.

&zA Cliffside Path~
&G This is the path down the west cliff. Here, the elevation is high 
enough above the floor of the Lost Valley that not much vegetation 
grows....if any at all. The path itself is fairly sandy, with small 
pebbles strewn about. So little vegetation is present that moss doesn't 
even grow in the damp shade in the rocks, however, there are many species 
of insects and a few animals scurrying about within view.

&zPath Down the East Cliff~
&G There is a combining of two paths not far down this path. It looks like 
the North Path, meets East Cliff Path, which is the path here. The 
entrance to "Lost Valley" is also not far south of here. The blue sky 
stretches out to the horizon, cut off directly overhead by the edge of the 
cliff beside the path here. Small green tussocks of grass jut up from the 
sand in sporatic consitancy, and those two words aptly describe "Lost 
Valley".

&zPath Down the East Cliff~
&G Beside the path here, there is a small, glistening brook, trickling 
softly down into a larger stream further down the cliff, which in turn 
runs into the valley, and then into a pool at the very center of the 
valley. Around the pool stands a small wooded area, and more woods line 
different streams and creeks. The grass is ever so green, and a hazy, 
twilight like mist rests over the scenery. All of this leaves the scenery 
with the appearance of an untouched utopia.

&zPath Down the Cliff~
&G The path splits here, one branch to the northeast, the other to the 
northwest. From here it appears that both branches converge with other 
paths heading down the cliffs. The sounds of wild, new creatures, echo off 
the cliff faces, and fill the air with noise. Even the cliffs here are 
filled with new and interesting life. The furs and hides of these 
creatures just might be worth a pretty penny!

&zPath Down the West Cliff~
&G There is a small, narrow, very rocky and barely detectable path that 
runs west of here, and into a cave in the distance. Northeast, it appears 
the North Path meets West Cliff Path and then continues on down the bowl. 
A small stream crosses the path there, and meanders on down the more 
gently sloping cliff to meet with a large stream, which then flows down 
into the valley to meet with a creek.

&zConvergence of Paths on the East Cliff~
&G Here, the North Path meets the East Cliff Path. The two merge and run 
on further down the east cliff, meandering about, slowly making its way 
down the steep face of the rocky earth. The West Cliff Path is also 
visible from here, acting much the same way as this path does, until it 
too reaches the level ground of the valley floor.

just to the east of here. Both paths look the pretty much the same, a 
slightly sandy bottom covered with pebbles, a steep rise on one side, and 
a steep drop on the other. The sand on the path is filled with small, 
strange footprints of creatures never before seen by the above world.

continues, leading its way down the cliff to the valley, or, from the 
other side of the coin, it leads up the cliff and out of the Lost Valley. 
Slightly south and a good distance west there is a dark cave, and a 
faintly detectable path which leads into it.

&zEast Path, Halfway Down the Cliff~
&G Small mounds of grass stand here and there about the path, miraculously 
making a life in the rocky ground, with little sustinance, but still they 
appear strong, and are vibrant green. On the face of the cliff above the 
path, grey and brown moss grows in the cracks, in the cool moist shade. 
Small bugs can be seen crawling between the moss in different places, 
feeding off of the fungus. The stone face even reflects a little light 
here and there between the moss where the sun hits the cliffside.

to and from the valley in this geographical bowl. In the distance to the 
east, the path down the east cliff is visible, acting much like this one, 
wandering about like a drunken mule. The path itself is predominantly 
sandy, and small pebbles line the way. Brown and gray algae even manage to 
grow on the rocks here, a sign that abundant life is not too far off.

&G The valley seems much closer now, being roughly halfway down the cliff. 
The path appears to continue on in the same state, a bit sandy for the 
most part, but still many small rocks and pebbles lying about. All in all, 
the path is in good condition, and quite easy to walk upon, and the 
beautiful view of the Lost Valley only makes the journey more enjoyable, 
and seem even shorter.

&G The path bends gently north of here, and from there it turns sharply 
east. The path also goes back up the cliff to the southwest. Looking up 
that direction one can see the cliffs towering above, and looming down. 
Along the cliff rim are a few large nests, apparently belonging to some 
kind of large bird, maybe some new specie of eagle.

many spots of the rock where soil and sediment has settled into different

floor. The air seems cleaner, and the noises of nature are more abundant. 
The valley itself still pushes its aura this far up, leaving the present

rings loud and clear. That sound, ever so threatening, can be no other 
sound than bones being eaten and chewed whole.

&G These are the Halugrath Plains, the beautiful, wide expanses of land 
which span the distance from the northern shores of Lake Gulwyle to the 
southern arms of the Alenxanth Mountain Range. The grasses are tall year 
round, taller than most men. The shortest blades of grass are at least 
four feet tall, and the tallest are almost double that. The wind 
constantly makes a peaceful whisper as it rushes through those grasses and 
travels across the plain.

&G&BRunning Branch~
&G Here, one of the many creeks which branch from the two rivers of the 
Halugrath Kingdom flows gently by. The water, like Lake Gulwyle, is 
crystal clear and shallow, the bed being made of millions of small, round, 
perfectly smoothe stones. Each stone is perfectly shaped in an ellipse, 
and the creek appears to be a finely paved road with water flowing freely 
down it.

&G&YHalugra Planari~
&G These are the Halugrath Plains, the beautiful, wide expanses of land 
which span the distance from the northern shores of Lake Gulwyle to the 
southern arms of the Alenxanth Mountain Range. The grasses are tall year 
round, taller than most men. The shortest blades of grass are at least 
four feet tall, and the tallest are almost double that. The wind 
constantly makes a peaceful whisper as it rushes through those grasses and 
travels across the plain.

&G&OGaran Halugra~
&G Halugrath Road, the main concourse of travel here in the kingdom of 
Halugrath. This road, though winding, is the main path from Bluehaven, to 
Tree Village, to Rafermand, or reversed if travel lies the other 
direction. The road itself is not a paved road, though it is flat and well 
trodden, and someone has at least taken the time to remove all the pebbles 
and stones.
