This is static generated example of the quest system.  Rafermand uses
both hand-made areas along with static areas created by the quest
system.  These areas are considered to be very dangerious since all
creatures are aggressive.  On the other side, there is a Captain in this
area with some nice loot if you choose to challenge her.  You have been
warned of the danger, proceed if you wish or use the "leave" command
to climb back up.

#200000
Lost Dungeon of Rolen~
You have found yourself even deeper under Rolen camp.  The air
is cold and stale leaving a very undesired foul smell.  If the
smell doesn't warn you, the dead bodies in this room should.  You
have entered a very unsafe area, proceed with caution.
If you so choose to flee, type the "leave" command to leave.

The path quickly starts to turn very dark here for
really no good reason.  Light almost seems to be eaten
at this point.  Whatever is down this path does
not want to be seen by anyone.

A strange light from above.~
A small bit of light shines in from above.  The light offers
a small amount of relaxation in a normally horid situation, but
whenever there is calm there is always a
nasty storm to follow, better be prepared

The sounds of battle can be hard nearby.~
The grunting of the enemy echoes loudly here.  Just a short
distance the enemy is preparing to delivery you the bloody death that
the vacation guide mentioned before arriving here.
Might be a good time to get ready for battle.

This room just oozes with bad intentions.  Evil seems to
pulsating from every direction and death is the only thing
certain in all of those directions.  Now would
be a good time to prey to whatever you beleive in.

Blood seems to pour out of the ground here.  All around
blood just drips from every corner and wall.  It almost
even looks like it is a slive in the way it is
moving.  Might be a good idea to start moving again.

A little bit of water sprinkles down the path.~
A small bit of water runs down the path here.  A small amount
of grass can be seen growing in this area, but not enough to really
have any affect.  It is nice to stand around
and look at the water and dream, but it is better to live.

A strange light from above.~
A small bit of light shines in from above.  The light offers
a small amount of relaxation in a normally horid situation, but
whenever there is calm there is always a
nasty storm to follow, better be prepared

The sounds of battle can be hard nearby.~
The grunting of the enemy echoes loudly here.  Just a short
distance the enemy is preparing to delivery you the bloody death that
the vacation guide mentioned before arriving here.
Might be a good time to get ready for battle.

A path full of blood.~
Blood seems to pour out of the ground here.  All around
blood just drips from every corner and wall.  It almost
even looks like it is a slive in the way it is
moving.  Might be a good idea to start moving again.

A path into darkness.~
The path quickly starts to turn very dark here for
really no good reason.  Light almost seems to be eaten
at this point.  Whatever is down this path does
not want to be seen by anyone.

A small path that winds into oblivion.~
This room just oozes with bad intentions.  Evil seems to
pulsating from every direction and death is the only thing
certain in all of those directions.  Now would
be a good time to prey to whatever you beleive in.
