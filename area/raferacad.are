Newbie Trainers

In the east part of Niemria is a location with a bunch of Newbie Trainers.
Most of the skills and groups in the game are located there at Beginner
mastery only.  Also, out of the 6 trainers there, all the skills and
groups are in alphabetical order and there is a sign in the first room
that tells you what letters each trainer covers.  If you go there and
do not find your skill/group in there, please don't tell the immortals
there is a bug because some are not there such as mountain climbing and
some skills that are remort skills.

Newbie Equipment

Rafermand is a newbie friendly mud, but we are not a newbie oriented mud.
We are looking for fairly experienced players who know how to play a mud,
but there are a lot of helpfiles and helpful players for those who are
new to Rafermand.  If you are new to muds, Rafermand might not be your
best choice for a first mud, but if you are persistant, you can ask
players and some immortals for help.  Now, on to equipment.  If you have
not noticed, you start out with very little in your inventory, you will
have to buy your gear in Niemria.  There are also 3 armor shops with 60
items combined and a weapon shop with 20 items so there is a lot of
choices, so here is what you need to know.

                                                 (For Locations see book12)

Now for weapons.  They are pretty straight forward, and the more expensive
one is, the better it typically is (also the slower in the case of a
bastard sword compared to a short sword).  It is important to get the
right type of weapon and one your class can wear.  If you are a pixie, you
have only one choise a knife.  Most classes can use either a dagger or a
sword, so those are your best choices starting out.  Help <class name> for
what weapons you are best with for your class.

Mist Forest

Mist Forest is a small area to the south of Niemria that offers mobs for
a new adventurer to do battle with.  If you are reading this, very good
of you and here are a few hints.

1.  DO NOT GO UP till you are atleast level 4 or 5 or you are buffed up
    with sactuary and sanctify.  The mobs hit harder and some of them will
    group up on you.
2.  The lower level mobs are pretty safe at all levels, they do not group
    up on you.
3.  It is important to go here and build gold at first to buy equipment for
    your journeys.  You will probably need 6000 or more gold to get fully
    equiped and if you are lucky you will start with about 2000.

Mainly it, make sure to check out 12 and 14 for more info over equipment and
Niemria.

Niemria

As soon as you get into Rafermand, you will start at the south gate of a
small town called Niemria.  It is located just a small distance from the
major city of Rafermand city.  Niemria offers you a few things that are
very important to take advantage of.  First, all newbie equipment is
located here, you will need to buy your own weapons, armor, food, or any
magical items you want to take on your journey.  You will only start out
with a few gold coins, so you are best buying your weapon first and maybe
pick up more pieces of armor as you go on.  Also, there will soon be a
group of trainers on the east side that will teach the Beginner ONLY
mastery of all 1st tier skills, so check that out if you need a skill.
Lastly, here is a map of the small town.

Weapons
                        
In Rafermand, there has been a change in how weapons work in relation to
classes and races.  First of all, a new field called weapon size has been
added to the Weapons.  When you identify one, you will see something like
this.

      Weapon size is 5
      
This tells you the weapon size of the weapon.  The size ranges from 1 to
10 where 5 is equivalant to that of a standard sword.  It is important to
know the weapon sizes because each race has a max and a min on the size
(such as 4 to 8).  So, you have to stay in this limit, also, if you have
a weapon of size 4 and one of size 5, you will hit more often (as in
number of attacks) with a size 4 than a size 5.  Typically, a size 5 of
equal level and stats will hit a little harder than a 4, so it is up to
you to pick which is better.

Continued at 1-1 (look book1-1)
~
E
book1-1~
Weapons pt 2
                       
Not only is it important to know the weapon size, it is also important to
understand how races and classes come into affect.  When it comes to races
there are two important things to know about, agility range and weapon size
range.  Agility is a stat you can see on score, it affects how often you
can swing your weapon.  Each race has a set range of how much agility it
can gain each level.  Races like elf or halfling (hobbit) will gain more
agility than the stronger/slower classes like a dwarf or ogre.  So, it
is important to figure what you want, speed or strength.  Also, remember
that dexterity and agility are TWO different things and do not affect
eachother.  Last, each race has a weapon size limit as mentioned above,
and the slower the class and the stronger the class, the more heavier of
a weapon they can wield (such as ogres).

When it comes to classes, they only affect agility.  Thieves get the most
bonus per level on agility and it is possible for them to strike much
more often than other classes.  Other fighting classes like monks and
warriors also get a bonus.  On the other hand, magical classes such as
mages and clerics will get a subtraction on their agility per level.

Global Board System
                     
Rafermand features a Global Board System (refered to as gboards) that allow
you to post a note from anywhere in the world.  A rather common feature in
some muds, but if you have not used one before, it is important to know how
to use it because reading and posting notes is essential.  The following
are the commands used.

gboard                                   Displays the gboards
gboard [number|name]                     Change to a new board.
gnote                                    Reads next note.
gnote read [number]                      Reads a certain note.
gnote remove <number>                    Removes a note written by you.
gnote list [number]                      Shows up to number notes.
gnote write                              Posts a note.
gnote catchup                            Marks all notes in this board read.

Most of them are pretty down and straight to the point, just type gboard to
get a list of boards and the notes on them and use gboard [number] to change
to that board to get a list and read the notes.  If you need to know more
about how to use the board system, just read the helpfile gboards.

Portal System
                        
Rafermand offers a very different form of using spells like portal and 
astral in the game.  We have a system of portals that are in the main city 
(Rafermand city, look at help map for number 21) and located all about the 
Wilderness near areas.  What you need to do is find these portals and mark 
them to transport back and forth between them.  To find portals, you must 
first go to that portal listed in the city above and use the command 
huntportal to be able to see and mark new portals.  Then, you can go out 
into the field and look for portals and use the command markportal once you 
found one.  However, once  you hunting for portals, you cannot use 
transportation spells/commands nor can you be targeted by one, nor can you 
enter a portal.  This makes it so you have to really hunt for them not chain 
through them.

Once you are done, you need to go back to the city and type huntportal once
again to stop hunting portals.  Now you can use your transportation spells
again.  There are a few more rules (main ones are can only use portal at
portal points and can only use other spells like summon/astral on people in
the same area) located in the help portals helpfile, so read that if you 
need to know more.  Lastly, to get a list of portals you have found, 
type listportals.
~
E
book4~
Kingdoms
                        
Kingdoms are pretty much the backbone of the caste system.  Kingdoms allow 
the players to take command of the mud and control a lot of the aspects of 
the game by running kingdoms that allow for building, placing of mobs and
objects, declaring war, trading, etc.  The Kingdom system as of Late August
of 2000 is still under heavy development, but there are some parts in for
testing for those who are willing to do so.

In order to get into a kingdom, first you have to reach level 10 in the
mud.  After that, you can use listkingdoms to get a list of kingdoms to
join.  After you find one that is accepting new people, you might first
want to ask the ruler if you can join or anything else you want to know
about.  After that, use joinkingdom <num> to join that kingdom.  Once
you are in, there are a lot of things that can be done, and you can either
read the helpfiles listed in help kingdom commands or ask the king or
higher ups in the Kingdom for more help.

As mentioned above, this system is in development and we are always taking
advice for ways to make it better or things to add to it.  We might not
get to it right away, but if it is a good idea, it will get in eventually.

Wilderness
                      
Rafermand offers a Wilderness or sometimes refered to as an ASCII MAP.  If
you do not know what it looks like, type help wilderness.  Wilderness is
a 250,000 room world that is used to connect all the other areas in the
mud and provide some walking distance and a way to use the new portal
system.  It also features a few things that you must know about before
going into it.

1.  Two views, box view (10 by 10 square, etc) or a Point of View look
    (you can see straight forward but not to the sides or behind you, looks
    like a flashlight view).  Standard is box view and you can switch using
    the config command.
2.  Movement cost is much more than in cities, so you will need a mount.  To
    get one, type help map to find the provider for mounts.
3.  Mobs show up in random encounters.  You are taken to a new small map 
    where you can do battle.  To flee, you need to get to the outer edge, or 
    you can recall.  Normal experience reductions happen if you flee while 
    in combat or recall while in combat.
4.  Can use the command lookaround to get a larger view of the map.  Also, 
    there is a spell called wizardeye available that provides a larger view.
    
Lastly, because the Wilderness is of decent size, I put together a rather 
cheap looking color map of the Wilderness at
   --> www.rafermand.com/colormap.jpg

As it is essential to thrive in life by learning new skills, it is important
in any mud to know how to learn the best skills and spells.  Rafermand offers
a very unique learning system which is a bit more complicated, but offers
a lot more freedom and power than typical level systems.

If you have played Might and Magic games, you will find our system rather
similar to how theirs is because it is based off of it, but there are
a few odds and ends you should know about first, but for now, here is
the system in a nutshell.

Instead of having 85 percent or so on, there are two values associated with
skills/spells.  Those two values are (Mastery) and (Skill Points).  In order
to advance your power in a skill or spell, you need to have the highest value
possible for both.  In addition, in order to gain higher mastery, you need
more skill points.  Below is a chart of what is needed to advance.
   
   Master   (Value 4) (10 Points, 100000 Gold) <-- Highest mastery value
   Expert   (Value 3) ( 7 Points, 20000 Gold)
   Novice   (Value 2) ( 4 Points, 3000 Gold)
   Beginner (Value 1) ( 0 Points, 500 Gold)   <-- Lowest mastery value
   

Now that this is explained, next on to the most confusing part, groups.

Learning System - Groups
             
In the skill system there are two kinds of classifications.

  Groups
  Solo Skills
  
Groups can be either skills or spells and are a set that is learned together.
This means if kick and punch is in the same group, you will learn both of
them and increase both of them by improving on the group.

It is VERY important to remember that you learn skills/spells in a group
by practing/increasing mastery in the group, not the skills/spells in the
group.  However, solo skills work as a solo skill, you increase it by
practicing/increasing its mastery alone.

Next, you are probably asking, how can I tell the difference.  It is rather
easy, you use the commands

    listgroups   and    skills
    
listgroups allgroups (a command) will provide you a complete listing of
solo skills (skills/weapons) and groups that you can obtain.  You might
notice colors, those are explained in the helpfile SKILLCOLORS.  With
listgroups, you can also type in the name of a group you see in the listing
and get the name of the skills/spells in it, or type in a name of a skill
and see if it belongs to a group (such as summon).  With skills, you can
use it to view the skills/spells that you already have.  It splits things
up into groups, skills, spells, and weapons.

Next, learning and increasing mastery..Continued at 6-2 (look book6-2)

&gLearning System - Increasing Mastery, Points, and Books
                      
This part has confused a lot of people in the beginning, but it has been
improved.  As mentioned in the first section, there are two values for
improving your skills, (Skill Points and Mastery).  Each is improved
differently.

Mastery is improved by mobs that have &G&W[TRAINER]&g before their name.
Each trainer teaches a limited amount of skills/groups, and you can get that
list by typing learn <name of trainer>.  It will tell you want solo skills
and groups are available to learn.  In section 1 there was a list of what
you needed to advance, so you might want to check that out again if you
need to (look book6).  Once you have found the appropriate trainer, you
can then use learn to increase mastery.  Say have have Fire at Beginner 4
and you are ready to learn Novice from Robert, you would type.
   learn Robert Fire Novice
Pretty much it.  The trainers are scattered throughout the land, and you
can get a listing of trainers by typing help SKILLCHART

Skill points are improved by mobs that have &G&W[PRACTICE]&g before their name.
All you do is goto the mob and use the practice command to improve a solo
skill or group (again you can get a list of what you can learn with
listgroups allgroups).  In order to increase the points, you must first have
learned Beginner Mastery though.  In addition, in order to go up to the next
point you must have the same amount of practices (which you can get from
leveling or visiting the questor).  So to go from 5 to 6 would cost 6
practices.  Pretty much it for practicing.

Finally, spellbooks.  Once you learn a spellgroup, you are still not done.
You must find or purchase the appropriate book for the spell you want to
use.  Most books can be found at one location, and the map on how to get
to the spellbooks, type help CITYCHART (please note this is Rafermand city
not Niemria which you start out at).  Once you get the right book, just use
the learn command to learn your new spell, and have fun.

That is all, I hope you can figure it out, and if you cannot, go ahead and
ask players/imms.  Also, there are shorter versions of this available at
HELP SKILLS.

Remort

Remort is a piece of code I worked into Smaug code that I have made
available to the public, it can be found at the Rafermand webpage if
you want to try it out.  Remort allows a player once they have reached
avatar to remort into a second tier class that is MUCH more stronger
than the first tier class.  When you remort, it is VERY IMPORTANT to
remembers these things.

1.  All equipment on you is GONE.  Give it away or have someone hold it
    for you.
2.  Very few things are kept.  You will keep your rank and caste.  You
    will most likely lose your gold and a lot of other things.  A few
    things are being fixed so you stay in clans, keep mounts, stay in
    kingdoms, and a few other things, but some of these hopefully will
    be fixed soon.  If you can pass something off that you have, do it.
    
Once you remort, you will start at level 1 and back in the beginning.
You will have no skills/spells from the last character, but you will
keep your name/password, etc.  Remorts require quite a bit more
experience to level, but are much stronger than first tier, so it can
make it easier at times depending on the class.

Questing
                         
We sometimes offer Immortal ran quests, but most of the questing is handled
by a Questing mob.  This mobs location can be found by looking at help
map.  Once you are on a quest, you will have a certain amount of time to
finish it.  Once you complete a quest, you will get quest points, and
sometimes gold, and the best part of questing, sometimes practices.  You
can use your quest points to buy practices or get lucky and get some
while doing the practices.  Since you cannot Master every skill there is,
you will find yourself questing later to get more and more points if you
wish to get better at what you do.

Next, there are stat questions.  Every 5 levels you will get a stat quest
point that you can use at a questor to get a stat quest.  You will have
till you level to complete this quest, and once you do, you will get
a stat point you can use at a trainer to increase a stat.

Last, just a note.  Some quests are for a token located in some area.  If
you get one of these quests, you might want to finish it quickly.  The
tokens are dropped, but are not saved, so if a reboot happens or a crash,
the token will be gone.  Ask an immortal to place the token if this does
happen.

Mounts
                         
Mounts are typically part of just about every mud, but in Rafermand, they
can be essential.  Out in the Wilderness, movement is a lot more than
in a city (some sectors take 30+ movement points) and players get very
little movement when you start looking at that much movement being used
per move.  However, mounts start out with more movement than a player can
get and certain mounts can level.  There is a mount shop in Rafermand city
(help map) that sells levelable mounts (not the pet store).  These mounts
work like pets, they save with you and everything nice like that.  They
level when you move them around enough, and they gain a little bit of HP
and some movement.  Mounts can go to level 100 and can get anywhere around
5000 or so movement points.  It is possible to wear the mount out by moving
it around (as in no or little movement left), but you can replenish it
with mount food.  Mount food can be located in Rafermand city at the
butcher.

Also, unlike pets, a mount cannot actually die.  Once it dies, it will
return back to Rafermand city recall with a slight movement max loss.  If
you lose your mount somewhere, you can always recall to get it back.  If
you ever find out that does not work, ask an immortal to see if it can
be fixed, not every bug is fixed in this system yet.  Lastly, you can
use viewmount to see your mounts stats.

Caste
                         
Caste is pretty much goes into the kingdom.  Kings can appoint others to
higher positions if they feel like sharing some of the power.  However,
right now there are a few things that caste is good for that does not
deal with the whole kingdom scene.

While being a player, you can advance your caste in Rafermand city.  For
that location type help map.  Once there, you can pay a small amount of
money to increase it (type setcaste for a list).  After you reach a certain
caste, you will get a small bonus to your hp/mana/agi, etc.  So it is a
good idea to max your caste out before remorting if you plan on remorting.
Also, in order to qualify for a Knight quest, you need to obtain the
highest rank possible for a normal player (Page).  Once you do that, you
can ask for a Knight quest to complete.  Read the helpfile knight for
more info over knights.

Other Stuff
                      
Here are a few tips for those beginning in Rafermand, and thanks for taking
the time to read this book.

* There are healing beds in Rafermand they are from recall s nw w w n w.
  They heal much faster than sleeping and can also heal mounts.
* You can buy spells from a healer just 2e from the bed location.  Typically
  cheaper than potions, but you cannot carry it.
* It is a good idea to stick to Niemria and the Forest to the south if you
  are below level 7
* Help mrafermand for the location of the Wilderness map
* Help map for a Map of the City of Rafermand, very useful
* Once out of the academy and the city, you might try some of these areas
  for equipment and leveling
    - Blood Marsh (in Tree Village, good equipment)
    - Wolf Forest (lv 10-13, aggressive mobs, make sure to be ready)
    - Shattered Refuge (Good exp up till 9-10)
    - Tullfuhrzky Manor in Pixie Forest has some equipment
    - Dwarven Village and Dwarven Daycare has some equipment
    - Nature's Retreat has a lot of good leveling mobs( 5 - 50 )
* Dula'Van and Anirandi have some potions not available in Rafermand City
* Might help to buy wizardeye scrolls in the beginning if you want to 
  explore the map
* Stay on the roads on the map, you will fight less mobs
* Read the laws (type laws)

&gA Misty Forest~
&OThe dark brown and black tree trunks surround everyone that enters
this forest. These massive trunks measure at least ten feet wide and
the mist blocks the true height of this forest. Although very dense and
mystic, this strange light purple mist does not alert the senses of any
danger. A sense of calm and a feel of excitement seem to be a hidden
bonus of this strange phenomenon.

&GThe Tree Tops~
&OThe tree tops are magnificent...large boughs spreading this 
way and that. A multitude of small insects and woodland 
creatures scurry around the many branches and limbs. The sun's 
light somehow manages to filter through to this layer very
vaguely, but enough to light even the forest floor below.

&GThe Middle of the Tree Tops~
&OThis area nears the very center of the forest tree tops. Still 
the light filters down steadily, and the number of insects and 
arachnids crawling through the living timber seems to grow more 
thick every step closer to the middle. The woods echo with the 
multitudinous cacauphony of sounds made between these smaller 
creatures and the larger.

&GThe Center of the Tree Tops~
&OThis is the center of the tree tops, and here, surely, lies 
the largest collection of the different species of the forest 
life, all busily going about their daily and lifely labors. Even 
the usually avoided bees seem to be too busy to notice any 
newcomers, as long as they do not wander too near to the hive.

&gAn entrance to a Misty Forest~
&OA strange, dark, misty forest lies to the south.  A lot of the light
that once blasted the open Wilderness is slowly being cut off as the
trees form a thick Canopy over the sky.  The sounds of forest creatures
can be heard in all directions, and even the famous sounds of the
infamous Yard Gnome can be heard.
