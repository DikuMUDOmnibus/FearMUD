Syntax: aassign <filename>.are  Example:  aassign edo.are
 
AASSIGN temporarily assigns all rooms, objects, and mobiles in the area
range to your pfile.  This allows you to use rlist, olist, mlist, and
reset list.  This also means that typing savearea, reset area, or 
instazone will affect this area.  
 
To save changes permenantly, type "aassign none" and foldarea.
 
&rWarning&w!! Do not have an area aassigned to yourself when getting personal
vnums assigned to you.  The personal vnums will overwrite the area file.
 
In order to assign a proto area to yourself, you must either have that
area bestowed to you by a Greater God or higher.
 
In order to assign a nonproto area to yourself, you must either have
that area bestowed to you by an Exalted+. Even if you have the area bestowed
only Lesser+ can aassign themselves nonproto areas.

online        - Shows who is online
<accounts>    - With no argument it simply shows account and its values.
editing off   - Removes the editing status from an account.
changes       - Adjusts how many changes an account has done in an hour.
                The default is only to allow 15 an hour (HELP CSET)
disconnect    - Forces the account to disconnect (along with the players)
name          - Changes the name of the account, must supply a password too.  The
                name and password you provide become the new ones
password      - Changes the password of the account
email         - Changes the email address of the account
ban           - Toggles the ban on the account
release       - Releases the player from the account, password is used to retrieve
                it later if wanted (or for another account to pick it up)
delete        - Deletes a player from the account.  Will try to delete the pfile if
                it exists, but will atleast remove the name from the player list.
reloadplayers - Reloads the account from file.  It removes the old data and
                inserts the new data on every player online belonging to that
                account.  Does not need to logoff the player to do so.

Accounts are, in the most simple of terms, used to store all your players.
Instead of having passwords for all of your characters (if you choose to
play more than one) you simply have one for all of them.  It also allows
for attaching values to all of your characters that you own (such as an
email address).  For the most part it is simply to help you remember that
new name you came up with and to only have 1 password for all those
characters.

1 'ACID BLAST'~
#Magic Mage Offensive~

For a Novice looking to master the ways of the Earth Sphere, acid blast is a solid spell
for causing solid damage.  Acid blasts creates a large wad of acid and it is thrown
at the target causing an unfun burning to the skin of the target, and is even capable of
going through armor in some magical way.

A very similiar spell to Acid Blast.  When the spell was created, the creators decided to
add an acidic effect to armor to make it even more nasty.  Acidic ball conjuers up a large
ball of acid that flies towards its target and stays there causing moderate damage and
reaking havoc on the targets equipment at the same time.

2 'ADDSLAB'~

Syntax:  addslab <metalSLAB> <vnum> <adjective> <qps>

Addslab is used to add in a new slab (ore) into the game.  The slab has to
be already created (see below for how to stat slabs).  The arguments
are as follows.

metalslab - Set this the same as adjective
vnum      - Actual vnum of the slab
adjective - The name that will be attached to the weapon/armor 
            (such as Dwarven Copper Long Sword)
qps       - Qps cost to purchase with quest rewards.
		
The slab is what is used to modify a base weapon and give the new stats.  The
stats are static (meaning there is no difference between 2 copper long swords).
The only difference will be between a dwarven and elven long sword due to races
affecting weapon size/weight/damage.   Here are the values for slabs.

v0 - Bashmod
v1 - Slashmod
v2 - Stabmod
v3 - Damage Mod
v4 - Weight
v5 - Durability
v6 - Cost		

Notes:  Projectiles only have a stabmod
        All values are added but cost/weight.  Cost/weight is multiplied.
        With shields, Bashmod is multipled against the base for "break damage"

2 ADVANCEDEXITS~
#Immortal Building Exits~
#END~
SMAUG supports having more than one exit in the same direction, as well as
the special direction 'somewhere', represented by a '?'.
 
If you already have an exit leading north, and would like another one, use
a plus sign '+' in front of the direction:
  redit exit +n 3001          - Adds another exit north to room 3001
 
To modify an extra exit like this, or to remove it, you'll have to refer to
it by number:
  redit exit #2 3002          - Change the second exit to go to room 3002
  (to know what number an exit is, do an "rstat")
 
For someone to be able to use the second north exit, you have to set one of
the extra flags (see EXFLAGS) like CAN_CLIMB.  It's also usually a good idea
to set the HIDDEN flag for any special exit so that it looks nicer to those
with autoexits on.
 
The AUTO flag makes it possible to go in a direction by simply typing the
keyword for that exit:
  redit exit ? 3001           - Create a 'somewhere' exit to 3001
  redit exflags ? auto hidden - Set the proper flags
  redit exname ? swim         - Set the keyword "swim"
  ... here, if a player types 'swim' in the room they will move to room 3001

1 ADVICE~
#General Newbie~
#END~
Because you took the advice and read the helpfiles, here is some helpful
advice that will get you started in Rafermand.

1.  Read as many helpfiles as you can.  Our system is very different!
2.  Instead of buying leather armor or ores, you can goto the weapon shop and buy copper clubs
    and break them down for copper slabs.  A copper club runs about 110 gold and is a good
    alternative (and that is your reward for reading this helpfile)
3.  Ogres are probably the easiest race to play because of their higher hp totals and resistance
    to physical attacks.  Fairies are the hardest due to their susceptability to physical attack
    and the rate at which they get sores (HELP SORES)
4.  It is not a good idea to leave this camp with anything less than 40 hp.  It is also not a good
    idea to leave if you cannot handle the Tier 3 mobs in the Battle Grounds.
5.  Once you leave town stay near the town and and see how well you stand up against the enemies
    out there.
6.  Staying on the road out in the wilderness will only get you 1-2 encounters.  Going off into
    areas like a forest can get you killed.
7.  You can hide from most of the easier wilderness mobs.  This can be an advantage early on.  You
    cannot move and hide at the same time with just hide (good for ducking out of a fight though)
8.  Save a little money for torches and food.
9.  Remember to break down any forge equipment you get and don't need, you will need the money.

listed by name only for the sake of brevity (if you want to know what each
is doing, use help <spell/skill name> or 'score').
 
Only way you can see the duration of an affect is to have the spell detect
magic casted on you.  Since elves inately have the ability to detect magic,
they can see how long an affect will last.
 
'Affected by' displays a character's affects separate from its spell/skill
affect list.  This is useful for ensuring that affects given from equipment
are actually functioning.  For example, if you are wearing a visor with
detect_invis but 'affected by' does not show you as having that affect, you
are not detecting invisibility.

Agent sphere is the practice of using stealth and wits to achieve one's goals.  The
agent sphere reflects toward the darker more illegal skills, but the ability to steal
and pick locks tends to help in many situtations a would be adventurer might come
across.  Besides the typical thieving skills, the agent sphere contains a lot of
movement related skills to make it easier for one to move on foot, and move undetected
if needed.  Lastly, one of the greater skills of the Agent sphere is the ability to
mix together different herbs and potions to give another advantage to those who master
this sphere.
~

1 AGGRESSION INSULT~
#General~
#END~
Syntax:  insult [target]

The aggression system is something that was introduced pre 2.1.  This allows
for a better group experience and thus different tactics for defeating the
enemies.  Every time you land a blow against an enemy, cast a spell that
hurts the enemy, or heal yourself or an ally, a value is assigned that
and it adds aggression toward you.  The target will attack you if you
are the highest on the aggression meter.

The order of most to least aggression follows

   Healing the tank
   Healing Other (see intelligence check below)
   Casting while not the tank
   Casting as the tank (see intellience check below)
   Landing an attack not as the tank
   Landing an attack as the tank
   Insult (depends on damage landed and intelligence check)

As noted, the more intelligent the target is, the less aggression is assigned
on the scenerios listed above.  In some cases, it can drop it down the list if
the target is extremely intelligent.

As before, using a high percentage blocking shield will make the target move off
of you.  If you are using a shield, you suffer an aggression decrease on landed 
blows and a slow reduction over time (in battle).  The better the the chance of
a shield block, the more increase you will see in the over time reduction.

Note:  There is a command called insults that is a nonskill version for RP.

----Continued in AGGRESSION2----
~

1 AGGRESSION2~
#General~
#END~
Next, a quick not about healing.  Healing is a very nasty aggression stealer that
can be used to keep it and also to get killed.  Anytime you heal someone (take
this as a hint, they have to be in a group to get this affect) you will get
aggression from all enemies that are fighting your group.  So if you have 3
enemies on Player A and 3 on Player B.  If you heal Player A you will get
on the aggression list of all 6 enemies.  Do this enough and you will become
the target.  It comes in handy here to be able to have a tank offer up some
heals of their own and perhaps have a second healer that can carry in some
healing in the background.  The same would go with group healing spells, expect
nearly instant aggression if you have a lot of members in your group.

Lastly, the insult skill.  This can come in handy for pure melee classes and
any other class that wishes to tank.  It uses 2 rounds (1 second) and attempts
to insult the target.  You always offer out an insult, but you never really
know if it lands.  If the target is unintelligent, the insult will almost always
land if you have any expertise in the skill, but on highly intelligent enemies
it has a reduced affect all the way to no affect.

Note:  This system does not work on players of course, insult is useless on players
and will not work.  Kingdom mobs still will not allow a buffer attack.  This is where
you purchase a bunch of cheap units to "pinch" away at the other forces.  In the past
as is the same now, the military units will target unequiped foes first and dispatch
them quickly.  Regular mobs still use intelligence checks to aim at different body
parts, but will no longer care about stances now (aggressive = more damage equals
more aggression, etc).

1 AGGRESSIVE 'AGGRESSIVE STYLE'~
#Combat Warrior Styles~
#END~
Syntax: style aggressive
 
This style of combat allows a fighter to strike more effectively, but
leaves many holes in his defenses as well. Fighters who know this tactic
can strike enemies for more damage, but their enemies' weapons will slip
through their defenses for slightly more damage as well.

1 AGI AGILITY~
#General Information Stats~
#END~
Agility affects combat speed only.  It will make it so you can hit more often even if you
are using heavier weapons.  However, since agility and heavy weapons typically go against
eachother, it will typically be used with smaller weapons.  The maximum agility is 100
points, the minimum is 10.

What Increases Agility
-------------------------------------------------
* Using light weapons
* Using no weapons

What Decreases Agility
-------------------------------------------------
* Using heavy weapons (increases when agility increases)

The ALIAS command allows you to set shortcuts for commands or long

entered commands. Example: alias heal cast heal samson
This assigns the command 'cast heal samson' to the alias 'heal'
so that typing in 'heal' will issue the full command.
You can create up to 30 aliases.

Typing ALIAS with no arguments will list your current aliases.
Your aliases will save with your character upon leaving the game.
An alias may only contain a shortcut for a single command. If more
sophisticated aliases are needed, a mud client package would probably
serve the purpose better.

warn. If you set it to a level everyone equal to that level and below will not
be allowed on.  Warn, sends a warning to the Warn: channel that someone if
logging in from the site, with a certaing class or race.  If you add the
duration, the ban will expire in that many days. Sites can be banned with the *
wildcard as well.  Be carefull however as *.edu would ban everysite from .edu,
or *foo* would ban anysite that had the string foo in it.
BAN show, will print out the reason why that particular site/race or class was
banned and by who.  Number can be a class or race name, a site address or
you can use # followed by the ban number.
WARN will toggle the warn flag on a CURRENTLY banned site/class or race.
 
ALLOW site/race/class  <address/race/class>  removes a site, class or race from

AOC is short for Area of Control.  Area of control is the surrounding area

the command showcontrol.  The colors in showcontrol represent the following

Blue - Your Kingdom
Red - A Kingdom you are at War with
Green - A kingdom you are Neutral toward
White - A kingdom you are Trading with
Orange - A kingdom you are at Peace with

AOC is generated by two things, the center of your town (showed as a T when
you use showcontrol) and the size of your town.  As the size of your town
grows, the AOC also will grow.  AOC is important for the following reasons.

1.  No other kingdom can start a town that will cut into your AOC
2.  Defensive units (Guards) get an extra advantage while fighting in
    your AOC
3.  Workers will dump back into your town if placed in your AOC
4.  It is the area of the map you can build in (help BUILD).  You can only

You can specify a level range to see a list of all areas with suggested

each area has a low and a high suggested range.  Suffice to say that if
an area's level range matches even one level of the range you request,
it will be displayed.

Syntax: armmilitary <unit/all> <leather/light/medium/heavy> <ore/default>
Syntax: armmilitary <unit/all> repair [appraise]

This is the command used to arm your military.  When you first purchase
a unit all it comes with is leather.  You can change this so the unit
is still using leather and gets a weapon or equip some actual armor
to the unit.  Each unit gets a specified weapon depending on the unit.
The size of the weapon and the type of armor is also affected by rather
use choose light/medium/heavy.  Light armor is typically the lightest of
the armor (chain) where the medium is the middle (ring/double ring) and
the heavy is the plate stuff.  Units already require a lot of time to
move, and putting on heavy armor drasticly affects this process even
more.  Below is the movement chart


UnMounted

3 seconds   - Leather     3.5 seconds - Light
4.5 seconds - Medium      7 seconds   - Heavy

Some units get a bonus to unmounted and/or mounted movement, so there are
other factors besides those default ones.  In order to use the armmilitary
command you need both access to command and access the despository.  This
command can only be used at the barracks of a town.

Lastly, you can repair the units equipment if it get damages or goes missing.
It will cost you a certain amount of ore depending on the amount of armor that
is intact.  If 95 percent of your armor is not damaged, you will only pay for
that 5 percent.  The appraise option just gives you how much it would cost
without actually charging you for it.  The ore requirements are as such for
the race of your kingdom

Race    Leather  Light   Medium  Heavy
---------------------------------------
Human   2        30      50      90

Ogre    3        45      70      130

Added recently:  You can now equip a military unit with default equipment.  The cost
is based on the strength of the unit, the race of the unit, and the type of the
equipment.  The first equip (not the basic leather on all start units) is free of cost.
Any changes after that or repairs will cost your kingdom change (typically about 1/8 to
1/3 of the cost of the unit for light to heavy armor).

The armor/weapons are actual forge equipment, but will be removed from the unit upon death
and if somehow the equipment is obtained, you cannot wear it, break it, or sell it.  The
strength of the armor/weapons depends on the unit.  It ranges from copper to mithril.  Lastly,
you can still use ores to say equip your excess steel to weaker units.

when casting it on newbies it is only capable of doubling the max hp
of your target.

Aura is the stronger of the two spells and will grant even more hp for
those big battles.

Backstab is used at the beginning of a fight to land a nasty blow to the
enemy.  In the hands of a master, a backstab can do more damage than a
critical strike.  While it is not as powerful as its Tier 4 counterpart,
assassinate, it is a very vital part of the agent's many weapons.

The only requirement of backstab is to be wielding a dagger like weapon and
have it in position for a stab.  In addition, being hidden to the enemy will
help you successfully land a backstab.

2 'BAN NEWBIE'~
#Immortal Punishment~
#END~
Banning a site is a form of last resort, as it not only affects the offending
player or players, but will also affect every other player from that site.
Before seeking to ban a site, even for a temporary level 1 banning, make
sure you have exhausted all other options first. 
 
In the case of newbie bans, most such instances arise through the actions of 
one or more abusive players who log in a newbie and begin swearing, spamming, 
threatening, etc.. Many times this has developed from an immature player's 
frustrations over getting a name authed. If you find a player going through a 
series of silly names trying to auth them, make every effort to try and talk 
with them first. If this fails, use Fquit to discourage them. If you have 
Disconnect, use this instead, as it is less provoking than fquit (makes it 
appear as if they simply lost their conneection). If they continue their 
efforts, send them warnings to get their attention. Use freeze if you have it 
(or if someone else is on who can use it) to get their attention and make sure 
received the message. Then, and only then, once you've exhausted all avenues
at being civil, you can use ban in good conscience. You've given the player(s)
every chance to cease their actions and given them fair warning over the fact
that if they continue they risk getting banned.

The banking commands allow you to manage your funds more effeciently.
Funds deposited in banks are safe from thieves, and are saved even if
you die, so storing some cash in the bank is a wise precaution.

To DEPOSIT, simply find a bank, and deposit any amount of gold you wish.

To WITHDRAW, simply go to the bank and withdraw what you need.

To see how much you have, type BALANCE, it will show you how much you
have on hand, and how much is in the bank.

To TRANS (Transfer) money from your account to another player, the other
player must also be online. Simply transfer however much you want to
that player, provided you have it available in your account.

Added to 2.0 is the ability to store equipment in the bank.  You start out
with 100 units of storage (100 weight and/or 1000000 coins).  You can
purchase more storage by using the balance buy command.

You can use the withdraw list command to see a list of your equipment in
the bank.

1 BERSERK~
#General~
#END~
Type:  Manual Battle Skill
Syntax:  berserk

Berserk gets the blood going nicely, very nicely.  Berserk can
be used in or outside of battle to go berserk.  Berserk will
give you those fiery looking eyes and increase the damage you
do with every attack, on the other hand, it will also make it
easier to hit you :-(.  While berserk, you cannot flee or have
anyone attempt to rescue you.  So don't go berserk unless you
plan on finishing the job.  On a final note, you go out of
berserk mode after a fight ends or the time on the affect wears
off

Another thing to note, as you gain more skill in berserk your ac
doesn't get better, it gets worse.  Your loss of ac grows with your
increased damage, so be careful with this one, it could get you
killed trying to get that extra few damage points.

NOTE:  If you are looking for berserk style type the following
(HELP BERSERK STYLE)
~

1 'BERSERK STYLE'~

This tactic is truly powerful, for it causes the fighter to allow pure
rage to flow through him, at the cost of his own judgement and care for
his or her well-being. While the berserked fighter will strike deeper

their weapons deeper into the berserker.

All of these commands use up their objects:  Potions and scrolls have a
single charge.  Magical weapons (typically of the staff family) have multiple
charges depending on the strength of the spell and the durability of the weapon.
Magical weapons can only be "repaired" using the recharge spell.  Using a hammer
to fix it or a blacksmith to repair it will no longer work.  Once the item is out
of charges the item will be consumed.  Use the spell 'identify' to see the remaining

Syntax:  repairwall <direction>

Walls are very useful for keeping people out of a certain area.  A wall in
the new system is considered a true wall or a door.  Doors are just capable
of closing/opening up the area and locking to keep unwanted guests out.  If
you find yourself unable to gain access to a locked door there is always the
bruteforce option of breaking the wall down.  Now, first you must understand
this action is considered an act of aggression and might be frowned upon if
you are caught.  Also, it takes a lot of weapon power to take down just one
wall, so either bring a bunch of spare weapons or a good friend to help you
hack down the wall.  Once you figure out that you want to break down the
wall, just use breakwall <direction> to start hacking down the wall.  Once
the wall gets damaged enough, it will turn colors so you can actual tell it
is about to break (help showascii for those colors).

Now, on the otherside of the equation, there is repairwall.  You can purchase
special hammers to repair the walls with buycaste.  These hammers will last
a certain amount of uses and will help to repair the wall.  It might actually
cheaper to break down the wall and rebuild it though, so that is something you
also might want to consider, but if you are trying to keep people out, sometimes
repairing is the best option.

1 CARRYBIN~
#Kingdoms Creation~
#END~
Syntax: carrybin on/off
Syntax: carrybin <obj> <dir>

Carrybin is the command used to hall bins that can hold the different resources out in 
the wilderness (help EXTRACTION help EXTRACT). You first start off by buying one of the 4 
different sizes of bins available to kingdoms. There is a Small bin, a Medium bin, a 
Regular Bin, and a Giant bin. Small bins are meant to be able to be halled by an average 
strength player by him/herself full of only 1 resource type (bins can hold 2 types). The 
Medium bin is meant to take one extremely strong character (perhaps an ogre) or two 
average strength players to hall back. Medium bins can hold twice the amount of Smaller 
bins, but are mainly only an advantage to those who can carry them. The Regular bins work 
good as a central storing unit. It takes 2 to 3 people to hall the bin back full, but it 
is much easier to transfer goods from a regular size bin to a small bin (help 
GETRESOURCES). The Giant bins hold 5 times the amount of a regular bin and require 
anywhere from 5 to 10 people to hall back, so they aren't meant to be moveable, just a 
central spot to dump your resource into. 

Now that you know how bins work, to the command. In order to help someone move a bin, you 
must type CARRYBIN ON. Once your help has carrybin on, you can type CARRYBIN <OBJ> <DIR> 
to move the bin. You will either move the bin or it will tell you that you don't have 
enough strength in your group to move it. It is also possible that you might not have 
enough movement between your group, and when this happens only those who can move will 
move, and the bin will stay back if it wasn't moveable. It is important to turn carrybin 
off so thaty you don't get dragged into moving a bin against your will (or for the enemy) 

NOTE:  You don't use carrybin to dump a bin into a town anymore, this will be handled
by dumpgoods.

0 CAST~
#Magic~
#END~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

Caste is used to set the caste ranking of a player or set the number1 or number2 of a kingdom.
It is best to have the number1 or number2 in the room when you set them.  You can also remove
the number1 or number2 by just typing number1 or number2 without the name argument (again best
done if the player is in the room).  If you wish to set the caste, there are a few rules to
follow.....

1.  Those who do not own land (don't own a town) can only be set as high as Knight.
2.  Those owning land can only be set as high as Marquis
3.  You cannot set the Ruling Caste, it is set when you appoint number1 and number2

Public channels are those that can be seen by everyone, regardless of their
affiliation with clans, guilds, orders or councils.  Private channels are
channels available to those with affiliations of some sort, and also tells.

The first channels you will have as a new player are SAY, TELL, and NEWBIE.

 - to use say, the person you want to talk to must be in the same room,
   just type SAY <message>.
 - to use tell, the target person may be anywhere within the Realms, just
   type TELL <name or 0.name> [message].
 - newbiechat is seen and used only by level 1 characters, members of the
   Newbie Council, and Immortals.

Lastly, a new of channels are configurable using the color command.  Any
color you set will change the output of the text only.....So, if you
see this

and you change the chat color to lets say pink, the text part that is in

1 'CHARM' 'CHARM PERSON'~
#Magic Cleric Assisting~
#END~
The charm spell, if successful, will place the victim (only mobs, attempts
to charm other player-characters may incur the wrath of the gods) under
your control for the duration of the spell.  While under your control
the creature is your servant, and may assist you in combat and other
more minor duties.  Use the 'order' command to give them orders.
 
Be warned, you are responsible for the actions of your charmed beast.  If
it should go awry and take the life of another player-character, you will
be charged as a murderer and will be hunted by several creatures around
the Realms.
 
Aggressive mobs will lose their aggressiveness while charmed, but will
immediately return to their violent ways when the spell wears off.  For
this reason, charmed aggressive mobs should not be taken into any area
lower from the one from which they came, and should *never* be taken
into Rafermand or the Academy.  Those found doing so will pay dearly.
 
As a matter of etiquette, charmed mobs should not be attacked.  You can
tell a mob is charmed if it is wandering "in a dazed, zombie-like state."
Be aware when taking your charmed mobs around other characters that any
area attack such as call lightning, gas breath or earthquake will hit
your creature and cause it to engage in combat.

1 COMBAT~
#Combat~
#END~
Our combat system is slightly different than other muds, so it is important to understand
how it works.  First of all, the "attack" command is attack, kill and murder will still
work, but they point to attack.  In order to start a battle, you can either use a command
or spell that can be used to start a battle (try it to find out), or use the attack command.
The attack command syntax is as follows

Syntax: attack <mob> [target body]

In our system you can aim at certain body parts or limbs: head, rarm, larm, rleg, lleg, neck,
body.  If you do not supply a target, you will automatically aim at the body.  In addition, if
you have not used the target (HELP TARGET) command, you will not attack till you choose another
attack (Realtime).  In addition, each skill/spell/attack requires a certain amount of rounds
to pass before you can continue.  When it comes to attacking with weapons, the weapon size has
a lot to do with the speed you can attack, if you are wielding too heavy a weapon, it will take
you much longer to attack.  In addition, your movement (HELP ENDURANCE) effects your time along
with the amount of armor you have on your upper body (everything but legs, HELP EQUIPMENT).  For
more information over what targetting a limb does, see (HELP LIMBS).

While in battle, it might be important to change your grip (HELP GRIP).  You can use grip to
change to bash, stab, or bash.  Each one of these attacks has its own type of benefits and
downfalls (HELP GRIP), so it is important to use the right attack at the right time.

When you are fighting, you will notice we have slightly different battle output than most muds
do.  You can get more information over that by visiting the helpfile (HELP BDESC).

Lastly, for more detailed information over how the system works (HELP COMBAT2).  This
discusses more of how the system works (NOTE: This is the update for the new system for

1 'COMBAT ART'~
#General~
#END~
Combat art is an automatic skill that increases your agility.  You will most likely
not see this in your agimeter but it will give you a slight bonus.
~

1 COMBAT2~
#Combat~
#END~
This helpfile comtains information over the workings of the new combat system
and changes made.  Here is a quick rundown on the changes.

1.  The system is now based on a 30d system unlike before.  If you have equal
    weapons versus armor rating you roll against a 17.  However, each grip type
    (slash, bash, stab) will make a difference on what damage you do.  Bash has
    a 6 slide, slash 4, stab 2.  This means anything from 11 to 23 for bash will
    be a hit.  11 being the least amount of damage and 23 slightly below 100 percent
    damage.  A 17 will be 50 percent and then it goes down according to a percent
    value.  Slash being a slide of 4 would be 13 to 21.  Anything below these values
    are a miss, anything above is a hit.  This mainly means bash will land more often.
2.  A roll of 1 is a critical miss.  Critical misses either damage your weapon, add
    extra lag time to your fight, or just simply miss.
3.  A roll of 30 is a critical hit.  Critical hits are 2 to 3 times the amount of
    damage of a full hit.  In addition, shots to the head/neck/body can cause an
    instant death shot.  Some mobs and all undead are immune to these shots though.
    You will have the best chance to do an insta to head, then neck, then body.  Besides
    instas, you can do a critical limb strike with a slash or bash grip.  This will cause
    the limb to be cleanly removed.  Slash has the best chance to perform a crit limb.
4.  Aiming at anything but the body increasing the chance of the target dodging your
    attacking.  Aiming at the body actually decreases it.
5.  Races now have dodge mods.  Fairy has the best, Ogre the worst, etc.
6.  Changed how the "sore" rate and damage to limbs work.  The mob health you have the
    harder it will be to develop sores or get your limbs hacked off.  
7.  Armor/Weapon damage has changes since there is no percussion.  It is based on how
    much damage is dealt.  The more damage the more wear on the weapon/armor.

1 COMBATART~
#General~

Type:  Automatic Combat Skill

Where enhanced damage is the art of inflicting more damage on the opponent,
combat art is the art of inflicting more damage quicker on your opponent.
Combat art slightly increases your agility the more you learn it.

1 COMBATSPHERE~
#General~
#END~
Combat sphere is the pure physical form of combat compared to what is offered in the
Spiritual sphere.  Combat tends to be a sphere that a lot of would be adventurers get
their feet wet in, but do not solely rely on.  The combat sphere is the best way to
get damage output up with weapons, but lacks in buffs and special skills that you
will find in Wizardry, Divine, and Spiritual.

1 COMMAND~
#Kingdoms Military~
#END~
Syntax: command [mob/all/range] <dir>.
Syntax: command [mob/all/range] <x> <y>.
Syntax: command return [range].
Syntax: command town <townname>

A simple command that will allow you to command UP TO 10 kingdom mobiles.

You can either command a group of mobiles to move in a certain direction using
the normal movement commands (n, s, w, e, n+e, n+w, s+e, s+w).  You group them
together like this

2n5e3n+e5snnee

This kind of movement is considered "dumb" movement which means they will go
there till they hit the spot or are blocked by something.

The other kind of movement is the <x> <y> movement.  You specify a location
up to 70 rooms away from you in any direction and they will try to navigate
a route to get there.  If they cannot find one, they will tell you so.  This
option is "smart" since they will navigate around obsticles blocking them.  The
ranges are from your location.  -y is north, +y is south, +x is east, -x is west.
So -5 0 would be 5 west and 5 -4 would be 4ne 1e

command return has a range of 15 and will comand any units in that range to
return to your position.  This is again a "smart" movement, they will try
to get to you as best as they can.

command town <townname> allows you to sit at the center of your town and tell
all units in that room to move toward a town connected to your town.  This is
useful for moving a group of units quickly between two cities.

2 CONDUCT~
#Immortal ImmLaws~
#END~
.               &c&w**Rules of Conduct**
 
&G&W1.  Transfer command can be used on any immortal and will not check
    against level.  It is not kind to transfer an immortal for no cause.
 
2.  Giving of items with SPECIAL BONUSES are not allowed.  Exa.  Do not
    give a level 2 player a level 50 sword, or take a level 2 sword, and add
    10 hitroll to it.  I find this, you will be warned, then if it is abused,
    you will be demoted, or removed.
 
3.  For no reason should immortals be snooping players without consent of Staff
    rated immortals.  Immortals of lower level, however, lose this right, so
    don't be going off and doing stupid things that can be logged.  Use a
    mortal if you want to remain safer.
 
4.  Imms are allowed *1* immortal for use, unless authorized by Staff.  If you
    have the advance command, do not advance your player beyond 50 without
    consent.
 
5.  Secondly, imms with advance have the right to advance mortals for "testing"
    purposes only.  You can not play your mortal with other mortals if you are
    cheeting with it.
 
6.  Immortals are expected to attend atleast 5 hours each week, if you cannot
    do this, please inform Xerves so he knows what is going on.  Imms won't
    be removed because of personal problems, but will be if Xerves doesn't
    know.
 
7.  Cheeting with friends or any other player is not allowed.  The rules
    are the same for bonuses.  Cheeting would be using your imm to stop
    fights, or give repetitive restores and the such.  Everything needs
    to be fairly fair.
 
8.  As an immortal, you are help to a higher standard then a typical player.
    PLEASE, try to avoid getting into stupid arguments, or odd situations.
    This makes you look bad, along with the rest of the immortal Staff.  If you
    have a problem, handle it in a reasonable manner, or ask a higher level imm
    to help you rid of the problem.
 
9.  DO NOT, and I repeat DO NOT force players unless you absolutely must.  You
    want to lose players really quickly, that is one of the fastest ways I know
    on how to do it (this does not include forced saves before reboot, or
    punishments).
 
10. Your immortal is your immortal.  Any other login by another address, will
    be almost immediate termination.  If you want another person to login,
    please notify a staff level member, and they will make arrangements.

can only give consent to one player in the game.  However, you can change
consent to any player at any time or use the none command to give consent
to nobody.  Consent is not saved when you logoff, so you will need to
regive consent once you log and your corpse can only be dragged if you
are online (you can be link-dead).  The Immortal staff will not be
responsible for any corpses lost or dragged elsewhere by a malicious
player so be careful who you offer consent to.

Consent is alwo given automatically if the corpse belongs to you or the

Copyover, also known as warmboot, is a process in which the mud will
reboots itself but you will say connected (well techincally this is not
true, but you won't see much difference).  Copyover typically provides
about five to ten seconds of lag and you will be able to enter commands
again.

When a copyover happens, you are saved and so is everyone else, but there
are a few things that aren't saved.

Groups
Fighting (if you are fighting you will stop)
Stuff that normally purges during reboots or crashes (like keys)
Stuff you might of dropped

Those are just a few things (there are probably more).  It is best to
get all your belongings or use anything that will disappear in a reboot
before a copyover happens.

Also, for immortals, it is important to savearea before one and loadarea 
once the warmboot is over because it doesn't save your area.

problem with only your character. 
   99.9% of the time corpses will save over a crash. The game will 
start back up with your character at the last place you saved or the
game saved you.

that I am familuar and have used ideas from, ROM and RoT.  Next, I need to
give credit to as much of the snippets that I have used, or any ideas from
other people I can remember (if you see something that belongs to you and

I would also like to thank Janus for getting me interested in doing
this way back before this ever started.  Also, thanks to Ghaleon/Stakk/
Octav/Qutius for being there in the beginning and telling me to switch
from RoT to SMAUG.  Also, thanks to Shai'tan for putting in a few
snippets.  Next, thanks to Remorhaz for coming up with some decent
ideas to put on the mud, and giving me a snippet to post on my page.
Lastly, but not the least, I would like to thank all the immortals
(builders/coders/skill makers/social makers/pests) that have helped
create what we have so far.  Without all of you, I would be doing
this all by myself.

-1 'CRITICAL STRIKE'~
#Combat Warrior BattleSkills~
#END~
CRITICAL STRIKE
Critical Strike is a very deadly skill in the hands of the skilled.
Being a skill favored by those trained in the arts and in theivery, 
critical strike will allow the user to strike at a very critical
part of the enemy's body and cause massive damage when they strike
it.  However, because the enemy moves around a lot, hitting the
target can prove to be quite a challenge.

A mysterious castle that reaches into the skies.  The castle can be
seen from Rafermand square and is rummored to be the place of the
undead.  The mothers and fathers of Rafermand educate their children
earlier of the dangers of wandering near the castle because of all
the corpses that have been dragged back my explorers and adventures.
It is rummored that the Lord of the undead inhabits this evil place
and there is also mention of "Flying Death"

1 CUTPURSE~
#General~
#END~
Syntax:  cutpurse <target>

Instead of sticking your hands into the coin purse of the target, you
simply use your trust dagger to open a nice hole in it.  This skill
is more dangerous because of the higher risk, but yields a better pay
out than steal.  Same rules apply here with reguards to players and
stealing coins.

Note:  Requires a dagger like weapon to use, where steal requires nothing.
~

1 DAGGERS DAGGERSTUDY DAGGERSTRIKE~
#General~
#END~
Type:  Automatic Combat Skill

Daggers is the practice of using a dagger more efficiently in battle.  Those
trained in the art of using a dagger will find they are able to strike for
more damage and strike a bit more quickly than those who are not trained.
Daggers is simply the first step toward mastering the usage of a dagger when
it comes to the arts of the stealth and the shady.

The skills daggerstudy and daggerstrike are simply additional training in the
use of daggers.  Daggerstudy focuses on increasing agility with the dagger where
daggerstrike focuses on doing more damage with a dagger.  Both with increase both
agility and damage, so getting all 3 skills in the dagger line will make your
job, whatever it might be, a little easier.

0 DEATH~
#General Information~
#Combat~
#END~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated in the newbie camp or at
the recall spot of your Kingdom's choicing.  Your corpse is left behind
where you were killed, together with all of your equipment.  Your gold
stays with you (mysterious is it not?).

Any spells which were affecting you are cancelled by death and your
constitution is lowered slightly. Following/groups are not affected by death.

Corpses decay after time.  When this happens the objects inside a corpse
will be dumped to the room it is in.  The objects last till a reboot or a
crash happens.  The corpse itself will not decay for 2 whole days so you
have plenty of time to go get your corpse.  If you cannot get your corpse
through normal means there is drag (HELP drag) and the spell summon corpse
(HELP SUMMON CORPSE).  Also, anyone who is grouped with you can drag your
corpse or loot it for you.

Lastly, the morgue (HELP MORGUE) was introduced shortly after the death changes.
You can use the morgue to retrieve your corpse.  If you die in a quest, you can
use QPS to get your corpse back.  If you die anywhere else it will either cost you
5 HP if you are have under 100 hp or it will cost you 5% of your hp if you are over
100 hp.  You have to wait 15 MINUTES if you are over 100 hp before you can pull
back your corpse.  All of this is done at the morgue (HELP MAP).

A deathblow is when a hit is good enough to kill the enemy no matter
how much life is left.  Deathblows can happen anywhere, but more likely
to happen to head shots and specially neck shots.  You can increase you
chance of a deathblow by using a stabbing attack.

A crit is short for a critical hit.  A critical hit does more damage than
a normal hit.  Critical hits can be increased in chance with the critical
strike skill (HELP CRITICAL STRIKE).  All grips have the same chance to
land a crit.

1 DEATHTRAP DT~
#General Information~
#General Movement~
#END~
A "death trap" refers to the scenario where one steps into a room and is
immediately awakened from death with no equipment or corpse. A corpse
recovery is not an option in this case as there is no corpse to retrieve.
 
There are also pseudo death traps that may appear to be a dt, but leave a 
corpse or transfer a corpse to another area. This is not a true dt. 
 
It is often advisable to look before one leaps and heed room descriptions.
DT's do not warrant a reimbursement, they are a part of the game. Gold, 
glory and favor are not affected by a death trap.

Declare is used to declare war, peace, neutral, or trading on another
kingdom.  In order to move up on the peace status between two kingdoms,
both sides agree (so to go from neutral to trading, both sides need to
agree to trading).  However, to go down from neutral to war, all 1 side
needs to do is declare war.

Once one side declared something that needs to be accepted by both sides,
the other side can either reject it or remove it.  Both sides can see what
is being offered by using castevalues or offers and offered.

#Magic~
#END~
Syntax:  cast 'dispel magic' <character>
 
This spell dispels magical affects on the victim.  It may be used as an
offensive spell to remove an enemy's magical advantages, or as a benign
spell to completely remove your own magical affects.
 
If you are not a mage, you must be affected by the 'detect magic' to be
able to use this spell.  Though mages do not necessarily need to use it,
being under the affects of 'detect magic' will reveal more information
unavailable otherwise or to other classes.
 
'Dispel magic' can be used by players and mobiles alike against either
players or mobiles.  It cannot remove affects from equipment, your race
or your deity; some other affects are immune to this spell as well.
 
When a caster successfully casts 'dispel magic' on themself they will
remove all of their dispellable magical affects.  If a mage successfully
dispels a victim, the number of affects stripped will depend on their
success and intelligence.  Otherwise a successful cast of 'dispel magic'
on a victim will result in the removal of a single affect each time
(victims will notice when and what affects are stripped).
 
WARNING:  this is an offensive spell, and its use on anyone other than
yourself will be treated as an attack on your target.

or wear heavier armor, as will be explained next.

Dodge is affected by the armor size of your armor.  No armor is the lightest and yields
the best possible chance to dodge.  Next is leather, chain, ring, and plate.  A cuirass
and heaume have the highest value when it comes to armor size.  If you are weighted down
enough, you will not be able to dodge no matter what your stats are or your ability in
dodge.

Lastly, dexterity affect and shields.  By using dodge, you will either increase it for
using it, or decrease it for not using it.  If you wear light armor and dodge often, you
will increase both your dodge skill and dexterity.  If you are equiped like a tank, you
will start to lose dexterity over a period of time.  Lastly, if you are using a shield you
see your chances of dodging decrease.  You can wear a buckler and dodge without any loss in
chance, but anything better than buckler will drop your chance to dodge.  Unlike before, it
is a flat drop not a percent drop, so it is going to be very hard to dodge with a large shield.
Dodge does not affect your ability to block with a shield.

Lastly, Tumble and Dodge are now linked in usage, see (HELP TUMBLE) for how this works.

1 DRAG~
#General AtPlayers~

Syntax:  drag  <character> <direction>
Syntax:  drag corpse <corpse name> <direction>

Drag will drag the victim in the specified direction if they are not
standing up.  It is often used to drag a person to saftey, but can
also be used to drag them toward harm :-)

A new feature to drag is the ability to drag a corpse.  This can be used
to safely drag your own corpse, the corpse of a party member, or the corpse
of an individual that gave you consent.  Drag can be used to move a corpse
anywhere in the world (in and out of areas if needed) and can be used in a
very nasty way if you give consent to the wrong individuals.

#General~
#END~
The following 4 skills are part of a set that do the same thing

   draw aggression
   greater draw aggression
   focus aggression
   greater focus aggression

It starts at Tier 2 and goes all the way up to Tier 5.  The skills are
one of the primary ways for a tank to hold aggro, by getting the hell
beat out of him/her.  Each skill adds damage done directly by hits or
indirectly through damage progs to their aggression meter against the
target that hit them.  The focus line adds the most aggression so those
who decide to choose the path of the warrior can enjoy these skills.

Note:  This does help but does not mean you can just set up a mage and
start nuking, this should help though in keeping some aggro specially
if your tank is helping with the heals/nuking.

Type:  Manual Battle Skill
Syntax:  drive enemy direction

Using the polearm as a battering ram, you can drive your opponent

a normal blow.  Drive can be used to start and you actually get
a bonus if you are mounted (if the attackee is mounted he/she also
gets a bonus to defend).  The more strength you have, the better
your chances.  If the drive lands it will do damage and move the
characters out of the room.

even from a corpse (TAKE is a synonym for get).
 
GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.
 
PUT puts an object into a container.
 
Use 'drop/get/put all' to reference all objects present.
Use 'drop/get/put all.<object>' to reference all objects of the same name.

In order to install a piece of forge equipment you must supply the forge
ore you wish to have load.  The forge ore argument is actual the number in
forge (1 - copper, 2 - bronze, etc).  Once you do this and instaroom the
object will be reset as the proper forge item (race will be that of the
mob holding/wearing it)

1 'DUAL WIELD' DUALWIELD~
#Combat Warrior BattleSkills~
#END~
A very important skill for those who are looking to make a living learning the art
of fighting.  Dual wielding allows you to wield two, one-handed weapons or a weapon
and a one-handed projectile weapon (ex. crossbow).  You can then use both of these
weapons in battle.  If you are dual wielding normal weapons, you will notice less time
in battle to hit.  However, you will randomly attack with both weapons, so you don't
get a choice of which one to use (two maces work out well).  Only thing to remember is
you cannot dual wield two-handed weapons and you must have enough strength to wield both
of your weapons

(Note: It is important to remember you cannot wear a shield or use missile
       weapons when you wield two weapons)

One of the arena commands, the duel command will, if accepted, transport the
combatants to the arena waiting room, giving others a chance to bet on the
outcome of the fight. It will then drop them into the actual arena where,
unlike in a normal challenge or chaos battle, the two will fight to the
death, so to speak. The winner will take ALL of the loser's pranking points
while the loser's character is reset.

If the duel is denied, the one who denied it gives up a portion of their pranking
to the challenger.

Duel show will display any outstanding duel challenges.

This can be a very dangerous command, so use it with caution. There likely won't be
any reimbursements for anything lost in a duel situation.

0 DWARF~
#General Information Races~
#END~
----------------------------------------------BIO----------------------------------------------------
Dwarves, are heavily divided upon the world of Rafermand, their motives as diverse as each individual 
culture of their kind.  Some are nomadic traders, who often travel with a stockier, nomadic,
mercantile breed of beardless dwarves.  There are dwarves that have grown taller and thinner, tilling 
the land and living in dark, cold forests.  There are the people of the underground, some bitter, some 
reclusive, some nomadic (within cavern systems), and some whom have become bulky even for dwarves, 
stronger, meaner, and adept at being found only when they wish it, travelling unseen in the underearth 
using inherit, passive magicks.  Standing between dwarves and other cultures is wholly dependent on the 
individual collections of the dwarves, as they have a highly developed clan heirarchy.  Dwarven 
metalworks are highly sought after, and each breed of dwarf is known for crafting artifacts suiting their
general cultures.  Dwarven weaponsmiths are incredibly well known, but their arts are so refined, that a 
true dwarven master is almost as rare as any dragon or greater mortal.  However, only the darkest
of dwarves are skilled at creating powerful, prized weaponry, as the peaceful branches of dwarven society 
prefer the theory of swords to plowshares.

         eat   <object> <container>      (eat directly from a container)
 
Drink instructs your character to drink from a fountain or a drink container
to alleviate thirst.
 
Eat instructs your character to eat an item of food or a magical pill (which
function in a similar fashion as potions); pills do not fill stomach space.
 
When you are hungry or thirsty (you will see messages at each tick that
tell you if you are starving or dying of thirst, and can check your
current state with either 'score' or 'oldscore'), you will not regain
hitpoints, movement points or mana back as rapidly as if you were well
fed and hydrated.
 
If you stay hungry or thirsty too long and you are not immortal, your
mental state will begin to suffer.  Your combat skills will be affected,
your coordination will suffer and you may begin to either hallucinate or
become depressed.  Eating, drinking and a little rest will solve this
problem after a short period of time.

2 ECONOMY~
#Immortal Building~
#END~
Each area will initialize (on bootup of the mud) with a pool of gold based
on the area's range and the wealth of each mob in that area.
 
The shopkeepers and thieves will automatically deposit gold into the economy
if they are carrying more than a certain amount (the higher the level of the
shopkeeper, the greater they will carry before depositing).
 
To allow mobprogs to be created to manipulate area economies, making them
interactive and interdependent, there are two mpcommands:  mpdeposit, and
mpwithdraw (see related helpfiles).  There is also an 'if economy' ifcheck.
 
The aset command can also be used to adjust an area's economy by hand
(example:  aset <area filename> low_economy <amount>, this will give
the specified area a minimum economy at the level you set).
 
Mobs will not repop with more gold than what they were originally created
with, but if the area economy runs low they will begin to repop with less
until the economy is replenished (as they all share the same gold pool).
 
Use foldarea to make changes to an area's economy with aset permenent.

1 'EDITOR FORMAT'~
#General Information~
#Immortal Building~

Syntax: /f [range] [width]

A very useful command when working with long paragraphs (particularly for
our builders).  What this will do is allow you to set any length on the
text you are typing, and when you are finished, just simply allow you to
format it to the typical length that is used in the mud (the stand is
to allow 640x480 see everything on the screen without line breaks).  So
once you are done, you will need to format your text, below is an example
and what it all means.

/f 1 5 75

Simply enough, this formats line 1 through line 5 to be spaced at 75 on
the right margin.  As of now, it will only space on the right margin and 75
is the standard for viewing.  Also, if you change around the range numbers
or make a number that doesn't exsist, it shouldn't work (but it won't crash
the mud either).

Well this attack doesn't do exactly what the name implies.  Available to only experts
in striking the arm, elbowbreak is a precission strike to the elbow that causes massive
amount of damage to the target.  While it is possible to break the arm with this
strike, it isn't always a sure deal nor is it more affective than any other arm attack.

1 ELBOWJAB~
#Combat HandtoHand~

The basic strike to the elbow learned by all beginners in the arts.  It is a simple

basic attack not targeted at a specific point in the elbow.  However, it is a good
starting point for those without a weapon in hand.

#General Information~
#Magic~
#Skills~
#END~
Elements are the elments you choose at the beginning.  There are 6 basic elements used in
Rafermand: fire, earth, water, air, energy, divine.  When you choose an element in the beginning
you are mainly choosing which element you can obtain Tier 4 spells in (help tier).  A Tier 4
spell is the strongest spell available in that group or element.  These spells are very powerful
and can only be obtained by the skilled veteran players of this game (so if you are a newbie you
have awhile to go).  In order to obtain such a spell you will first need Tier 3 spells up to
Master status, a book for your Tier 4 spell (which is not the easiest thing to obtain) and a trainer
to teach you this Tier 4 spell.

There might be other things that your element might affect later (such examples as limiting an opposing
element Fire:Water Earth:Air Energy:Divine) and making you resistant to your own element.  However, none
of this is implemented atm, so look back to his helpfile later if any changes are made.  For more

much harder, they channeled all their energy and even their soul into
the land to curse it with the magical powers of the elements.  Shortly
after, they died from the experience and the elemental canyon was born.
Because of the problems this would cause with the creatures getting

0 ELF~
#General Information Races~
#END~
----------------------------------------------BIO----------------------------------------------------
Elves, an enlightened, magical race.  Elves, though advanced in almost all aspects of civilization, 
are reclusive by nature, and in the world of Rafermand, they are highly shunned both for
their prowess in the arcane and their spiritual beliefs, their beliefs even during the Time Before The 
Gods that something greater than mortal guided the fate of the world.  The arrival of new deities has 
disrupted power amongst the elven spiritual heirarchies, and internal turmoils prevent elves from 
actively engaging in outside relations, so over the years, in some areas, elves slowly became the thing 
of myths, even though some of their kind are known to wander and engage in relations with the other 
races.  Another factor contributing to the outcast nature of the elves is that outsiders are forbidden 
from stepping foot within the great, living citadels of the elves, citadels hidden from all but the 
greatest of prying eyes.  Racially, any of the 'darker races' are shunned by elves.  Any elven colony 
which tries to maintain outside political affilations is outcast from even elven society, and the 
practitioners of the darkest of elven arts find that few, even the greatest of evils, will trust or 
accept them.  The rare individuals that practice these forbidden, immortal magics never coexist with 
others like them, and as such, are incredibly rare, and shortlived, when they are discovered.

EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items).
INVENTORY lists your inventory.

You will also notice a * before an item, this is used to quickly spot the damage
done to a piece of armor or a weapon.  Below are the following colors and what

A &c&w*&G is for an item that has no condition (anything that is not
armor or a weapon).  Everything else has a color.  If the condition

See helpfile (HELP EQCOMMAND) for help over the comands equipment, inventory, and

Our equipment system is also slightly different than other systems.  We have 5
"key" armor slots: head, arms, legs, chest, neck.  There are other slots, but
they are mainly for holding bags, sheathes, and robes.  They possess little to
no advantage in protection.  The other 5 slots are used to defend against attacks
to the limbs they cover (HELP LIMBS HELP COMBAT).  It is important to have neck
and head gear because a landed blow there can be lethal and cause death with only
one hit, no matter how little damage it does.  Each piece of armor has a defense
rating for bash, slash, stab (HELP GRIP).  The better the ore and the bigger the
piece of armor, the more protection it covers for that area.  Also, neck and head
gear seems to do a better job than the others protecting their areas (HELP FORGEARMORS)

When it comes to weapons, each weapon can be used to bash, slash, stab (help GRIP),
but each weapons typically tends to be better at one than the others (HELP FORGEWEAPONS).
In order to change which one you are attacking with, you would use the (grip) command
to change how you are gripping the weapon to strike with.  This is important if you
enemy has special armor that is strong in a certain area, or you want to switch to
a certain type during a battle.  Switching grip takes a few seconds in battle (HELP
COMBAT) so beaware you just cannot change grip.  

Any extra equipment you have may be sold at a shopkeeper or broke down and sold
at a forge (HELP FORGE)

&w&CKnown only to the most elite sorcerors in the realm of Fire, Eradication is the
annex of strength in their Realm.  Eradication is capable of producing extreme heat
that is capable of making bones disappear on contact.  Those who are fortunate to

2 EXITMAKING~
#Immortal Building BuildingRooms~
#END~
The 'redit exit' command is used to create, modify and remove exits in a room.
Currently there can only be one exit in a certain direction.
The syntax of the 'redit exit' command is as follows:
redit exit <direction> [vnum] [exit-type] [key] [keyword(s)]
direction: one of: n, s, e, w, u, d, ne, nw, se, sw or ?
vnum     : the room number in which the exit leads to.
exit-type: a number detailing the exit -- has a door, open/closed/locked etc.
key      : a number corresponding to a key object which can unlock the door.
keywords : keywords used to refer to the door, (or exit).

If only 'redit exit <direction>' is specified, the exit will be removed.
The 'key' field is optional when specifying keywords.  All other fields are
required previous to the field desired.

Examples:
redit exit n 3001           - Creates an exit north to room 3001
redit exit n 3001 3 gate    - Changes the exit north to have a closed "gate"
redit exit n 3001 3 15 gate - Changes the gate to allow use of a key vnum 15
redit exit n                - Removes the north exit

See EXITTYPES for generating the exit-type value.

1 EXTRACTINFO~
#Kingdoms Creation~
#END~
Extracting goods from the lands is not a skilled job, but one that does
require special equipment.  In order to extract from the lands, an
individual needs to be appointed a worker by a member of the kingdom that
has the ability to appoint (minappoint).  After that, they need to purchase 
equipment in which to extract the lands.  Certain equipment is better than 
other equipment, so either pay a nice price for the good stuff, or just take 
your time with the poor stuff.

Once you start extracting, you are able to hold a certain amount of material
on you.  The amount is influenced by your strength, so an ogre or
another strong class makes good workers.  Once you are full or tired of
extracting, it is possible to drop the goods off into a resource bin.
Also, it is possible to completely extract all goods from one spot.  After
that, you will have to wait quite awhile till it regenerated enough material
to be useful again.

#Kingdoms Creation~
#END~
There are a few things Extractors can extract.  As an extractor, that player
can only extract one thing at a time, however, they can either change it
themselves if they have the proper caste or ask someone who can.  The below
is the types of extractable material

Gold (Value 1)
----
A very valuable raw material that is used to purchase unique things in the
kingdom.  Not to be confused with gold coins though.  

Iron (Value 2)
----
The basics for producing large equipment that requires a harder material than
wood or stone.  Iron cannot be used to make iron ore or slabs that players
can use to make equipment...

Corn (Value 3)
----
A basic food item that can be used to feed people with or trade.

Grain (Value 4)
-----
Another basic food item that can be used to feed or trade with.

Lumber (Value 5)
------
Very valuable to Carpenters, needed to build just about everything in the
cities of the Kingdom.  A very important material in allowing a kingdom to
grow.

Stone (Value 6)
------
A slightly harder material than Lumber, but not as durable as iron.  Stone is
used to pave roads and paths, make walls, and other various objects that might
be needed by the kingdom.  Stone is a natural product of the world and cannot
be grown like corn, grain, and lumber

Fish (Value 7)
-----
Fish can be extracted from rivers and noswim sectors.  Typically, it takes longer
to get fish from the world, but it is a non-seasonal food source that can be pulled
during any month.  Fish grow back very quickly so you can make great use of your
river/noswim sectors for food.  You can also terraform your own noswim sectors.

0 'EXTRADIMENSIONAL PORTAL' 'EXTRADIMENSIONAL'~
#Magic Mage Defensive~
#END~
One of the newly born spells that was brought to the world when Xerves first
made his presence known.  It was becoming a problem with a few of his underlings
not being able to carry the material, equipment, and the loot that he/she needed.
So in response to this need, Xerves crafted one of the few new spells in the
world, extradimensional portal.

The extradimensional portal takes a great time and care to master because the
first portals created by a master wizard are quick small in size and cannot hold
much more than a paper sack.  But the patience of the wizard will be rewarded in
the future with the ability to easily hold more loot than any other ways possible.
The people who possess this spell are said to be under Xerves's constant watching

#General Information Races~
#END~
----------------------------------------------BIO----------------------------------------------------
Faeries, perhaps the most diverse of all the races, probably most resemble the humans in idealogy.  
Faeries are incredibly diverse, and they are incredibly chaotic, with very impulsive, fluid
political affiliations.  A sacred pact with a fairie is about as credible as a verbal agreement with a 
drunken ogre, as such pacts are oft forgotten seconds after they have been made.  Most fairies
are incredibly gifted at a natural magic, harnessing spells and invocations inaccessible to any other 
race...yet few use their power for more than the continued growth of their hidden cities.  Faeries are 
the most diverse of all races in physical appearances, ranging from the cherebum-like images most 
rumours within Rafermand detail, to the dangerous, wingless faeries possessing great thorns in place 
of wingbones.  There are races of faeries that are not wholesome by nature, but all faeries share a 
common realm, serving one royalty alone, and as such, rarely share totally opposing external relations.  
Mistrusted by all larger races as a general rule due to their finicky nature, it is hard for a faerie to 
form friendships between any others.  As a general rule, the collective motive of the faeries is simply 
assumed to be the preservation of their secret, secluded realm.  There are tales of a village where 
outcast faeries, and their sylvan counterparts, the elves, coexist...but such a place would be guarded 
almost as closely as one of the great living citadels of the elves, or the secret home of the faerie 
people.

1 FAME~
#General Roleplaying~
#END~
Fame system is part of the introduction system.  Fame is a number formulated
by how famous you are.  How do we measure this, well it is a secret.  You don't
know your own fame, but as you spend more time online and do more famous things,
you will become noticed and people will start to learn your name.  This can either
be a good or bad thing.  If you are a thief and you become famous, well, that is
not a good idea if you are trying to be all stealth like.  The best away to avoid
being famous of course is remain hidden to everyone by using a cloak and hiding
your face.

Once you reach a certain point of fame, people will know you by your lastname.  After
another value, people will know you by first name and last name.

1 FANS PK PKILL~
#Combat~
#END~
The FANS PK System (developed by Rook, Nevon, and Ely and coded by Xerves)
FANS (Full-loot/An Item/No-loot/Safe-from PK System)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are some of the Player Killing Zones?

   Some zones will not be PK and some will. There is not an exact list of which zones have
   PK portions in them, but by word of mouth and notes posted to boards you, the player, will
   find out quickly. If you enter a full-loot area then you will know right away when you enter
   that section.

What is FPK (Full-looting Player Kill)?

   FPK is a lawless zone: none of the laws in regards to conduct apply in FPK:
   you can harass, swear, taunt, spam, whatever suits your fancy. However, the
   connections rules regarding multiple characters are still in affect in FPK; meaning:
   you have multiple PCs in an FPK zone, you will be dealt with severly.
   FPK is full looting (all of your eq and the gold on your person will be in your corpse)
   meaning anything on your corpse when you die (NOT necessarily PK'd) can be looted.
   Entering FPK is a voluntary action requiring player acknowledgement: complaints
   will fall on deaf ears.  No PK or looting of your clan members or your group members
   will be tolerated while in FPK.  In FPK, you will gain XP for PKills and will
   lose XP from PDeaths.  However, conspiring to FPK someone with their consent for
   XP _IS_ against the rules.  There are no reimbursements, no CRs, no immortal help at
   all will be given to those in FPK.  If an immortal breaks this rule, please report it
   to a Staff Immortal (caste Staff or Admin, lv71+).  Repeated violations of these rules
   will result in the Immortals having a field day with your pfile.

What is APK (An Item Player Kill)?

   An Item is for players who cannot jump all the way into the realm of losing it all
   upon death.  An item zones, when you die, only one item will be removed from your
   corpse when you die.  This item, upon death, will fall from your corpse to the
   ground and *IS LOOTABLE* by anyone in the game.  So, your killer has to grab the
   item quickly before some other individual takes his/her prize.  The items that
   are selection to fall from your corpse are the items you are equiped with, so
   be careful.  The same rules involving player connections and taunting do apply
   in APK areas, and experience is given per kill.  Finally, just like FPK areas, you
   will be warned with a nice message before you enter an APK zone.

What is NPK (No-looting Player Kill)?

   NPK is a PK environment with restrictions.  The laws of Rafermand are in an NPK
   zone(no taunting, harassment, etc.).  There is also no looting in NPK; a corpse
   in NPK is to be a left a corpse in NPK: no removal/addition of objects.
   Also, in NPK, initiating PK with someone in a fight with a mob is against the
   rules; also against the rules is to help or hinder this mob in any way
   (assuming of course you are not formed with the person in question).
   No camping in NPK will be allowed (HELP CAMPING). In NPK, XP is _NOT_ gained from 
   PKills and XP is _NOT_ lost from PDeaths. There will be NO mob-stealing/kill-stealing. 
   Kill stealing is attacking a mob when another player is engaged in combat with the mob.

What is SPK (Safe-from Player Kill)?

   Basically SPK is that: no PK actions or violations of the Rafermand Laws will be tolerated.
   Also, banking (HELP BANKING) is not permitted in SPK, unlike NPK or FPK. Also in SPK, like
   NPK, no mob stealing or assistance/hinderance of mobs fighting PC's will be tolerated without
   said PC's permission.  However, just because it is a safe zone, it is not safe for everyone.
   Individuals marked "Thief" or "Killer" are safe nowhere, and may be attacked in a safe
   area.  In addition, law inforcement of a local area have the right to attack in a safe
   zone.  Lastly, it is possible to shove a person out of a safe room if you move quickly.

Fasting is simply the skill of teaching your body to use less food and water for

#General Information Credits~

FeAr stands for Forming Everyone's Addictive Reality. It is the name of 
the current version of the code base we are using now. We are still a 
SMAUG derivative mud, but we feel we are making steady ground to being 
something much more differently than a normal SMAUG mud, or a normal any 
kind of mud at that. 

If you are asking that we are giving out our code know because we have 
named it, the answer is no. I have done a lot of work to get this mud to 
the point it is now and do not plan on giving away my work at this moment. 
I might consider it later, but please do not ask me. 

Lastly, I don't mean this in any disrespect to the SMAUG creators or 
anything, but just simply pointing out that we are much more different 
than that now. So thanks for all who have distrubuted code and helped form 
what this mud is today and please look at the credits for some of that 
info.

affects the weight check and will not give you any other advantages that increasing
one's strength would.  Featherback is learned through moving.

Featherfoot is the ability to move quicker while on foot.  Those who are well
trained in this skill will find he/she is able to move quicker when winded
from moving around a lot.  Unlike shadowfoot, featherfoot does not actually
decrease movement cost though, but it will work together with shadowfoot to
provide a very effecient way to move on foot.  Featherfoot is an automatic
skill that is learned when you actually move around.

it is just put it in and see if it works. Only tip I can provide is to remember it gives

Projectiles are wielded weapons which allow players to hit victims
without being in teh same room.  Projectiles have a few forms in Rafermand
and those include: bows, crossbows, and slings.  Each type has their own
ammo (arrows, bolts, stones) and each kind typically has their advantage
and disadvantage.

In order to fire a missile weapon, you need to be wielding that weapon in
the 'missile wielded' slot.  You can do this by just wearing the weapon or
typing 'wield <weaponname> missile'.  These weapons will only work in this
slot.

In order to actually fire the projectile (arrow, bolt, stone) you need to
be holding it in your hand, so you guessed it, you cannot dual wield while
you are firing, so you might consider wearing a sheath if you want to use
your missile weapon.  Once you have your hand open, you can either put an
arrow in it, or you the nock command to draw and nock the projectile for
your weapon.  Then you can use the fire command to fire at a target.

In addition to all of that, you also have a few firing options.  You can use
the aim command (help aim) before you fire, fire directly at a target in the
same room, fire in a certain direction (which will hit the first mob or player
in that direction), or just the normal fire <dir> <target> command.

Lastly, remember that you can fire at both players and mobiles, so be careful in
what you choose, you could accidently hit a player and it is considered a pkill
attempt.  Illegal pkill is not tollerated and you should stop immediately and
contact an immortal, if it is legal, shoot away.

When you are firing in the wilderness, there are a few things you need

Since the wilderness is more 2d than regular areas, you will find
yourself needing to shot ne, sw, etc.  Use aim to target an enemy and
use fire target to shoot at that enemy.  Typing aim without a target
will pick up the closest mob.

If you fire your weapon and it is not long enough, it will fall to
the ground just before your target.  If you are aiming, you will not
fire the weapon, so again, aiming is the better idea.

#Combat~
#General Objects~
#END~
Syntax:  fix <item needing repaired> <item which to do the repairing>

Fix is the command used to repair damaged armor, weapons, and sheaths.  Fix
can only be used on damage items and cannot actually put back together something
that is broken.  In order to use fix you first need to have the item you want
to repair in your inventory and an item to repair it with.  The most typical
items are repair hammers, which are sold in Rolen Camp at the Bare Essentials
shop.  Once you have your hammer and the item you want to repair, you use the
fix command to start repairing it.  It might take a few times before it starts
to repair, so keep using it till you get to a point that it is ok.

Using fix is rather expensive and unless you have tons of cash to spend on repair
items, it is best to take it to a blacksmith and get it repaired there.  To cut
down costs, there is the repair skill (Warrior sphere) that will increase your
chances of repairing an item.  The skill will increase after repairing weapons/armor.

Syntax:  fixed <message>
         fixed list
 
This command records your message (250 chars or so max) to a permanent
record file.  All changes made to live areas, made with foldarea, etc.
should have some kind of entry recorded here.
 
Your name and the roomvnum in which you are standing at the time are
automatically recorded when you use the command.
 
If you post a note about the change, please make a fast entry pointing
it out.  (The board in 1215 is best for such notes.)
 
Using 'fixed list' will display the contents of the current fix record.
 
NOTE:  This file supports color tokens, be careful with them.

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.

During battle, if you fail at fleeing you will have to wait a few more
seconds to try again.  In addition, sometimes you will trip yourself up
trying to flee and suffer in your armor department.  This only lasts a
few seconds as well.  While in battle you cannot recall and you cannot
recall till after 1 minute of not being in battle.

In order to RESCUE successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.

If you folda something and realize there's a mistake, and you've only
folded it once -- don't do anything else.  Post a note or find Xerves.
 
Do not fold changes into non-quest areas that are quest related.  If you
must do this, write a note or ensure it's changed back.

Syntax:  for <argument> <command>
Syntax:  for <argument> <command> <target>

For allows an immortal to perform a command at or even on a large
number of targets.  The arguments include:  all, mobs, gods.

Example:  for gods gl, you will 'glance' in the room of every god
who is online (include link-dead)

You can also perform an action on the argument target.
Example:  for mobs poke #, you will perform the 'poke' social on
every mob in the game.

Syntax:  forage food [quick/normal/long]
Syntax:  forage water [quick/normal/long]

Forage skill is available for anyone to use, but actually learning the
skill will make it more useful.  Forage can be used to find food in areas
that you would think to find food (Hint:  Outside).  There are a few varieties
of food that can be found.  You have 3 choices of time to take to search.  The
longer you search the better chance of finding something.  Lastly, if you forage
out in a developed corn field you will have a great chance of finding...corn!

Water can be foraged from a fresh source of water or you can forage in some other
sectors to see if any water is available.  You will need something like a dragonskin
to hold the water.  If you forage in freshwater sectors (river, swim/noswim) you will
automatically get water no matter what your skill is.

-1 'FORGE' 'FORGE SYSTEM' 'FORGING' ORE ORES SLAB SLABS~
#Combat~
#General Objects~
#END~
Forge is used to create most of the equipment you will be using in the game.  Forge is both
a system in the mud, and an actual room that is used to do the forging.  It works as such.

There are 19 ores in the game (for a list help FORGEORES) and each ore can be used to make the
80 or so weapons/armor capable of being created (HELP FORGEWEAPONS  HELP FORGEARMOR).  All you
need to do is goto a forge with some ore and charcoal, or slabs.  You can find or buy ore in the
game and you can typically find charcoal being sold at an ore shop.  Once you get the right
materials, all you do is goto the forge and use the forge command

Syntax: forge slab <ore #>
Syntax: forge create <ore #> <weapon #>
Syntax: forge break <weapon/armor name>
Syntax: forge list [type] (to see a list of forgeable types)
Syntax: forge ores (to see a list of ore slabs that can be done here.
Syntax: forge appraise <weapon/armor name>
Syntax: forge sell <ore #> <number>

* Use (forge slab) to create a slab, you must have the ore and charcoal in your inventory
* Use (forge create) to create a weapon/armor.  Type (forge list) and (forge ores) to get
  the ore and weapon number
* Use (forge break) to break an already forged item down into slabs
* Use (forge list) to see a list of items, can put in an optional type (ex: head)
* Use (forge ores) to see a list of ores
* Use (forge appraise) to see how much ore an item will break down into
* Use (forge sell) to sell slabs you don't want.  They are bought at 1/10 of sell price

A very fierce spell in the arsenol of the Water Mage, Frigid ball can be as deadly as
it can come.  An experience Water Mage can conquer a huge Ball of Water and can power
it up to the point where it is so cold it will freeze anything that it comes into
contact.  Once this ball is created, it is thrown at a target or two and causes massive
amounts of damage.  A very frigid death can only be waiting for such targets.

2 FURNITURE~
#Immortal Building BuildingObjs~
#END~
It is now possible to sit/sleep/rest/stand on furniture, as well as
assign the furniture to recover mana/hp/movement for a player who is
on the furniture.  Here is how all of this works.

value0 - Max Number of people on obj (default 1)
value1 - Max weight an object can take before breaking (default 750) 
value2 - sit/sleep/rest/stand on furniture (more below)
value3 - Percent of health/move is gained by furniture (100 is times 1)
value4 - Percent of mana is gained by furniture (100 is times 1)
         **Default is if the value is 0 and default for v3 and v4 is 100** 
As for value2, it uses bitvictors, and here are their numbers

&G&WSIT ON -    1        SIT IN -    2        SIT AT -    4
STAND ON -  8        STAND IN -  16       STAND AT -  32
SLEEP ON -  64       SLEEP IN -  128      SLEEP AT -  256
REST ON -   512      REST IN -   1024     REST AT -   2048
&g
To make those work, you add the numbers together, say you want
to be able to sit on, stand on, sleep on, and rest on the object,
you then would add the numbers together and put in value2, 585.

Also, you can only select an on/in/at option on the actions.  This
means you cannot select sit on and sit at for one piece of furniture.
If you do this, it will only be sit at.

Lastly, you can examine a piece of furniture to get an idea of its
stats.  Very useful!

1 GAG CUTGAG~
#General~
#END~
Syntax:  gag <item> <target>
Syntax:  cutgag <item>
Syntax:  cutgag none

A very fun skill and a very useful skill.  By using something to stuff
the mouth of your target you can silence your target preventing the
target from casting and speaking (besides emotes).  If the target is
not prepared with an item to cut the gag off, it is literally impossible
to cast a spell unless you run out of gags.  It is possible to have the
gag removed with no item but it will take a lot of time to do it and the
target can simply put a new one on you afterwards.

On a side note, the gag lasts anywhere from 5-15 seconds or so if you don't
do anything with it and the chance of landing a gag is higher if you are not
fighting so when in battle it probably is not wise to use it unless you have
mastered it (since it does cost you battle time to apply the skill).

Lastly, the a forged knife, dagger, or dirk can be used to cut a gag off and
you can buy the gag item (a long cloth cord) from the general item dealer in
Rolen camp.

What is the world when you don't have a place to bet all of your money?
Well, gambling mobs allow you to do such things.  As of right now,

might add in support for playing other players.  Also, only a few games
are in right now, but I am sure more and more will be added later.  Also,
a mob is only skilled at playing one game, so if you want to play multiple
games, you will probably have to walk around and play elsewhere.  Lastly,
only one player can play at a time.

2500 resources.  In order to get resources from a bin to carry, you would type something like this:

  getresources medium 5 all (HELP EXTRACTION for type value)
  getresources medium 5 50
  
You can either use all for the <amount> (saves the thinking, the code will do that for you) or if you
just want a specific amount, you can specify a value.  For the <type> you will need to use the values
and you can find them at (HELP EXTRACTION).  This will transfer lumber (wood) to your character and you
can them use dumpgoods back in your town (HELP DUMPGOODS).  To move resources from bin to bin, you would
do something like this

  getresources medium 5 all small
  getresources medium 5 1950 small
  
Again, it is best to use all unless you need a specific amount.  All will check the amount in medium and
the amount small has left and take the maximum amount.  Once you have the correct resources in the right
bins, you can use carrybin (HELP CARRYBIN) to move it back to your town.  (NOTE:  Sometimes you might be
moving from like bins, 1.bin is the last bin listed, 2.bin is second to last bin listed, etc)

1 GIVEORDERS~
#Kingdoms Military~
#END~
Syntax: giveorders [mob/all/range] <orders>.
orders - stationary patrol warn attacke attackn attacka nopass report invite noassist.

Giveorders is the command that you use to control the military mobs and what
actions they will perform.  It is important to set the orders you want so
the mobs will attack enemies, defend land, or just give out a warning.
Below are the values available.

stationary  sentinel   patrol [range]
------
Stationary mobs won't move till attacked, patrol mobs move around patrolling
a block of area, sentinel mobs won't move reguardless if they are being attacked
from a distance.  Mobs that are patrolling move in a square the size of the range
you provide.

warn [range]  attacke [range]  attackn [range]  attacka [range]
----
The combat/lack of combat variables.  Warn simply sends out a message
to any non-friendly kingdoms (neutral or lower) that this area belongs
to your kingdom (range is 10)

Attacke, Attackn, and Attacka are actually used to attack roaming mobs
that belong to other kingdoms.  E stands for Enemy Status, N stands for
Neutral Status, and A stands for All.  Meaning, if will attack ANY member
of any kingdom that meets that ranking or below it.  All will simply attack
any non-kingdom member.

nopass  report(Report is not in use as of yet)
-------
nopass will not let any non-kingdom member pass.  It will ask the individual
to go back in the direction he/she came from, if not, he/she will be attacked
If he/she is a mob, he/she will be attacked on sight.

invite [range]  noassist
-------
Invite will invite one kingdom mob at a time to assist in battle.  This
mob will come to assist unless it has noassist setup.

conquer
-------
Mobs that are set to conquer will start to conquer a town.  It takes 3 days to
conquer a town.

nocloak nohood attackh attackc needintro
-------
nocloak, nohood, and needintro are nopass like commands to not let anyone pass
that has a cloak on, has a hood on, or is unknown to the kingdom (respectively).
Attackh and Attackc (hood and cloak) will attack any player with a hood or cloak
on if they are in the same room (there is no range like attacka).

Even though the death process was changed a bit to increase the progression toward
death if you about to die, there is a period of time where you could go either way
and theoretically sit there for eternity.  If you wish to simply die and forgo the
process, you can use the giveup command to drop your health down to the level at

gnote catchup                            Marks all notes in this board read.

These commands are used with the new global board system.  The boards are
OLC boards in Rafermand and commonly have important notes to read.  Please
only use these boards for what they are attended for.

Changing between the boards is accomplished using the GBOARD command.  To change, 
type GBOARD <number> or GBOARD <name of the board>.

To read a note with a specified number, type GNOTE READ <number>. Note that 
unlike the standard note system, a note has the same number in GNOTE LIST and 
GNOTE READ.

Posting a message is as simple as writing GNOTE WRITE. You will be moved
into interactive mode, where all you see are prompts for the fields like
To:, From: etc. You will be automatically put AFK while writing a note.

To see the list of the notes in the current board, type GNOTE LIST. Typing
GNOTE LIST <number> will list only <number> of the last notes in the area.

You can remove your own note by using GNOTE REMOVE <number>. Implementors may
remove other people's notes. Implementors can also select how many days
their note is kept before being purged. 

To let only immortals see your note, address it to "imm". To let players of
a specific level and above, address it to that level (no other recipients may
appear in that case).

This board system was created by Erwin S. Andreasen, erwin@pip.dknet.dk, aka

Mystic Adventure's note system (mud.gel.ulaval.ca 4000).

1 GRIP~
#Combat~
#Combat Warrior BattleSkills~
#END~
Grip is both a command and an automatic skill.

The skill is automatic, once practiced.  The skill causes you to grip
your weapon tightly as someone tries to disarm you, making it far more
difficult to successfully disarm you.  This skill will only increase as
you are engaged in fights where someone is attempting to disarm you.

As for the command, it is used to switch between bash, slash, and stab while
in battle (HELP COMBAT).  Each one of these types of attacks have their
advantages/disadvantages, and they are as follows.

Bash - Typically armor has the highest rating for this attack, meaning it
doesn't land as much.  However, it can do percussion damage.  This damage
is not as much as landing a blow, but it will do a little bit of damage
every time, also damaging armor and the limb.  (NOTE:  Percussion damage
cannot do a deadly blow to the neck/head).

Slash - A balanced attack, the armor value for slash is typically lower than
bash and the damage from slash is a bit more than bash.  Slash can cause a
little bit of percussion damage, but it is mainly used to land blows.

Stab - Stabbing weapons are capable of doing the most damage and taking down
an enemy is a carefully landed blow.  Stab does not do any percussion damage,
but sometimes it penetrates armor and lands blows or kills the target.  Typically
the choice of assassins and those who want the battle to go quickly.

#General Communication~
#General AtPlayers~
#END~
Syntax:  group <character>, group all, group, group disband
 
'Group <character>' adds someone who is following you into your group, making
them a group member.  Group members share experience from kills, and may use
the GTELL and SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will
automatically join the fight.
 
If character is already a member of your group, 'group <character>' again to
remove them from your party.  Removing the character from the group does not
stop them from following you, however.  A character can also leave a group
by using the 'follow self' command, in which case they will both leave your
group and stop following you.
 
'Group' with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.
 
'Group all' groups all eligible players following you in the room.
 
'Group disband' allows the leader to disband his group (members will stop
following and are ungrouped).

grub 20 room=7070 class=0    Display 20 mages who logged off in 7070
grub  0 class!=2 class!=3 class!=4   Count the number of mana users
 
You always need to specify the number of lines you want displayed. The
reason for that is that we don't want to ask for a list and then get
surprised to find that it's 15,000 lines long. You can get a count
of the players that match your criteria by requesting zero lines.
 
GRUB will tell you how many lines there are in the list no matter how
many you ask to display. So if there are 15,000 players that meet your
criteria and you ask for the first ten, GRUB will tell you there are
15,000 in total but will only show you the first ten.

2 'GRUB EXAMPLES'~
#Immortal Building~
#END~
Here are some examples illustrating common usages:
 
Example:
 
grub 20 or hitroll>150 damroll>150 gold>200000000
 
Suppose you want to search for "suspicious players". Suppose you want
to see players who have more than 200 million gold or whose damroll
exceeds 150 or whose hitroll exceeds 150 you can do that as follows:
 
Normally GRUB lists players who satisfy all the conditions you specify.
But it can also be used like this to list players who satisfy any one of
the conditions.
 
The operand "or" ensures GRUB will list players who satisfy any one of
the conditions.
 
If you had specified:
 
grub 20 hitroll>150 damroll>150 gold>200000000
 
That would show you players whose hitroll exceeds 150 and whose damroll
exceeds 150 and whose gold exceeds 200 million. It would be a much
smaller list and you would miss many suspicous players.
 
Example:
 
grub 20 name>ska name<skb room>=21000 room<=21499
 
Suppose someone complains that a player with a name like "Skathamaga"
picked up some of their eq and promptly quit the game. The player isn't
sure of the exact name of the thief but is sure it starts with "Ska".
The thief quit the game somewhere in New Rafermand (vnums 21000-21499).
 
This example will show you players whose name starts with "Ska" and who
last quit the mud somewhere in New Rafermand.

0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~
#General Communication~
#END~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>
 
All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.
 
SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.
 
TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.
 
REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.

1 HAGGLING~
#General~
#END~
A very useful skill if you want to have more money.  Haggling is the
art of purchasing objects at a better price.  This applies to merchants
(NPC or Kingdom NPCs), mount shops, and repair shops.  The only rule here
is that you can never buy an item less than the worth of the item, as with
repairs and mounts, you get a better price every point you get :-).

1 HAND-TO-HAND HANDTOHAND 'HAND TO HAND'~
#Combat~
#Combat HandtoHand~
#END~
Syntax:  command <target> [right or left]

This group refers to the skills listed int he sphere.  You will not automatically
attack with these skills in combat if you learn them.  However, you have to type
them in syntax: command <target> [right or left].  You only need to supply the
right or left if it is an arm or leg attack.  Once you type the command, you will
attack the target with the skill then have to wait a certain time to attack again.

In addition, you can use these skills even if you have some weapon equiped and if
you plan on using these skills know that no weapon improves these skills, it is best
to turn of target when using them, and there is no "auto-target" for hand-to-hand.

Note:  You can type command target [right or left] to automatically attack your attacker
This is handy with target.

1 HARVEST~
#Kingdoms Management~
#END~
Harvest time is very important in Rafermand because you need food to feed
your people, and not having any food for a full game year could be absoultely
devistating to a kingdom.  So, it is very important to understand how this
harvest system works and what is the best avenue of approach.

To start off, there are only 2 kinds of foods in Rafermand at this moment:
corn and grain.  Corn and grain both grow at a different time, the times
are the following

      Corn -  April - July (Game Time) (Help TIME INFO for Conversions)
      Grain - June - September (Game Time)
      
During the following times, any planted grain or corn fields will start to
increase from 0 to the max of 6000.  Even if you plant a corn field in May,
it will also start to increase till July.  After the end of the last month
of growth, the amount of resources will drop from whatever the amount there
is now to 0.  It takes about 1.5 game months go go from 6000 to 0, and this
is a flat reduction (so .75 months for 3000 to 0).  Growth is not flat, and
it depends on how many resources you already have.

So what does this all really mean?  Here are some tips.

1.  Always plant atleast twice as many fields as you need food for just in
    case you have to harvest one month early or late.  The more you plant, the
    more time you have to harvest
2.  Try to plant both kinds of food and attempt to harvest them.  
3.  Purchase silos if you need to store extra food.  All that food is going to
    do no good if you don't have somewhere to put it.
4.  It is typically a good time to start extracting anywhere from the last month
    of growth to 15 days after the last month.  Ex for Corn: July 1 - August 15
5.  Talk with other kingdoms, they might be interested in a trading agreement for
    your extra food or would be willing to sell you food for something else like
    coins, wood, or stone.

1 'HEAVENLY BLAST'~
#Magic Mage Offensive~
#END~
An odd spell, named from what the first sorcerer that discovered this spell thought happened.
In Legend, an anchient Sorcerer was testing out his new found power, and started to utter
some words.  And suddenly it appeared the heavens opened up and blasted what was his friend
into oblivion.  It was so fast and so sudden that it appeared his friend was there one
second and then gone the next.  The sorcerer could never duplicate the pure strength of
what happened before, but was able to create a spell that causes a mysterious power to
simply appear from the heavens and blast the living hell out of a target.  Heavenly Blast
is the strongest of all Tier 4 spells.

will be selected if you do not specify a page.
 
NOTE - Always, when creating a new help entry, type Help <new entry name> 
       prior to creating your entry. A pre-existing help file associated 
       with that keyword may already exist.
&Y
Colors &wcan now be added to help files using the same command set that changes
a player's prompt. &bMultiple &Ycolor &wcombinations can be set on a given line
including ^bbackground^x colors. However there are a couple of quirks to take 
note of:
&Y
    1) At the very least, the first character of a help file cannot be
       either the symbol '&&' or the symbol '^^'.
    2) Color changes have to be separated by at least one character. ie,
       '&&Y.^^r' will work, '&&Y^^r' will cause problems. 
    3) Color codes are imbedded within text and _do_ count in note buffers
       for line length. ie, watch out for <Long Line Trimmed>.
&w
Colors should be used to &Yenhance &wthe help file, or specific parts of the 
help file. Tact and restraint should be used if considering the use of colors.

2 HELL UNHELL~
#Immortal Punishment~
#END~
Syntax: hell <character> <number> <hours or days>
Syntax: unhell <character>
 
The hell command sends a character to hell for a given period of time.  It
automatically releases the character when their time has been served.  Upon
being helled, the character receives the message, "The immortals are not
pleased with your actions.  You shall remain in hell for <time period>".
 
Hell takes arguments of either hours or days.  To hell someone for 3 hours,
"hell <character> 3 hours".  To hell someone for three days, "hell <character>
3 days".  Hell will default to hours if hours or days is not specified.
 
You may not hell someone for more than thirty days with the hell command.
 
To release a player from hell, simply "unhell <character>".

giant addition of helpfiles added from 2.1.1 to 2.1.2 was due to
using of this command.

Syntax:  hindex toplevel
Syntax:  hindex <index> [nohfiles/collapse]
Syntax:  hindex map

hindex (help index) is used to browse the help index available in Rafermand.
You can either use the variable toplevel to see only the toplevel of the map
and click on there to view helpfiles/indexes in that index.

hindex map is used to show the whole map of the index.  This might not be the
best idea because it will scroll and you will have to scroll back up to click on
the index you want.

Lastly, you can use hindex <index> to look at an index of your choice.  There is
also the arguments of nohfiles and collapse.  nohfiles will not show the helpfiles
in the index and collapse will show all the indexes and their helpfiles below the
index you chose.

(NOTE:  There is a value called shorthelp in config.  This will make help not show
 similiar helpfiles when you type help <help file>)

On a final note:  hindex uses mxp to allow you to point and click (HELP MXP)

this command was initially designed as a maintenance tool to help us
track help files, it is also available to players so that they can
capture a listing of the help files available to them. 
 
Note - You may only view help files that are coded for viewing by your
       level or lower.
 
Note - The list of help files is quite extensive, and the command does
       not as yet have a way to filter/shorten the list. Screen capture
       is, at present, your only recourse.

0 HOBBIT~
#General Information Races~
#END~
----------------------------------------------BIO----------------------------------------------------
Hobbits, a passive, docile race of naturally contented, short, stocky species, the hobbits tend to get 
along with most civilized races.  They bear no ill will to any save those whom have harmed the hobbits, 
and even so, they rarely bare grudges for long.  They are prized for their natural mind for trading, 
and are commonly involved in competitive guilds.  Few hobbits practice magick, and it is unknown if it 
is from simple lack of interest, or inability to do as such.  Due to their hand in trade, hobbits find
it easy to negotiate treaties to benefit themselves.  Due to this very nature hobbits make for good
agents and this is where they specialize.  Hobbits tend to be a bit stocky, but they also possess a lot
of nimble qualities that make them perfect at dodging attacks and learning the skills of the agent.
The hobbits live in a variety of environments, depending on their needs.  Some live in traditional, 
hollowed out hills, others find that artificial shelters, wrought of natural materials, are more 
suitable.  Hobbits only truly hate anything that would deny them the simple pleasures of everyday 
life, so their villages are more or less open to any traveller.  Combining this with their guilds 
gives the hobbits a knack for collecting even the rarest of trades, as well as information.  Being 
fond of gossip,  the elders of Hobbit villagers have an army of innocent spies  reporting to them.  
Hobbprattle, a derogitory name given to the seemingly pointless, nonsensicle  gossip of the hobbits, 
is a notorious form of transferring information, as their oversimplifying of information is only 
readily understood by others of their kind.

apples have been tainted with the blood of their god, and will decrease hunger
and also restore health to the one who eats the holy food.  However, due to the
great amount of energy it takes to channel the spell, it puts a major magical
drain on the caster.

HOLYLIGHT is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and

easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

INVIS is a toggle which makes you completely invisible to all player characters
of lower level than you, and to all mobiles.

When an immortal is INVIS, they will have a flag on the who list which 
indicates their level of invisibility, such as (51) for INVIS 51.  A 
similar flag will also appear when you 'LOOK' in a room - this flag will 
say (Invis 51).

HOLYLIGHT will not allow you to see immortal INVIS characters who are
higher level than you.

1 HOOD CLOAK CLOAKS ROBE ROBES~
#General Roleplaying~
#Combat~
#END~
Syntax: hood on/off

By getting a cloak (one can be found at Bare Essentials) you can effectively cloak
your identity from everyone but the immortals.  By wearing a cloak you first hide
your equipment and inventory from anyone trying to sneak a peak at it.  This can
be useful because you can hide your power from your advesery.  The other option
that is useful is the ability to hide your identity while wearing the hood.  If
you type hood on you will fasten your hood up and you will become unknown to everyone
around you.  This can be handy if you plan on mugging and killing an individual, but
it is typically viewed as a threat to hide your identity from an individual.  In
certain kingdoms, they might even have their guards set to not allow people to pass
if you are cloaked and/or wearing a hood.  So, as a final thought, just be careful
about roaming around in a cloak because anyone who wants to hide their identity is
most likely asking for trouble.

Humans, as in all worlds, are fickle.  Humans serve many masters, many goals, and numerous

and as such, are adept at pushing their culture upon others.  Humans especially distrust the races

#General Communication~

Syntax:  ignore
Syntax:  ignore <character>
Syntax:  ignore reply/none
 
Ignore allows you to ignore other characters in Rafermand.  All tells,
says, socials, and emotes from these characters will be blocked (gagged
out).  You will still see their communications through public channels,
however.
 
Simply typing ignore will give you a list of all the characters you are
currently ignoring.
 
Ignore <character> allows you to add or remove a character from your list
of ignored players.  If the name is already on the list it will be removed.
If the name is not on the list it will be added.  Note that only the names
of actual characters will be accepted and that it is not necessary for
them to be logged on at the time.
 
Ignore reply will cause you to ignore the last person to send you a tell.
This can be used to prevent invisible people from spamming you.
 
Ignore none will set you to ignoring no one.

#General Objects~
#Kingdoms Management~
#END~
Syntax: imbue <amount> [item]
        imbue with amount and no item specified will release mana into the room's
        node, if there is one.

Imbue is a skill used to transfer some mana from yourself to an item or a room.

The purpose for this is to give people alternative sources of mana to be used for
spells of various kinds.

Imbue an item:
    You need 2 things for this, a gem (the rarer the gem, the better it is), and
    some jewlery to place the gem into.
    You do this by using the SETGEM command (see help SETGEM)

    Once a gem has been set in a piece of jewlery, you can then imbue the resulting
    item with mana. That mana can then be drawn from the item in order to cast
    spells when your mana is drained.

Imbue a room:
    To imbue a room with mana you first need to find a node. The only way to do this
    is by imbuing mana into different rooms. You will know when you have found a node.
    These nodes generate their own mana, but at relatively slow and small increments.
    They can store very large amounts of mana, and are constantly generating more.
    With these nodes you can cast special spells that need huge amounts of mana to
    function.

2 'IMMORTAL RULE' 'IMMORTAL RULES' IMMORTALRULE IMMORTALRULES~
#Immortal ImmLaws~
#END~
&gBelow are a list of rules for Rafermand involving Immortals.  You are
to know these rules from the point they they are posted and you are
notified.  Any rule added later will not be held against you unless we
feel it was a "common sense" rule.  Some rules might not be here, but we
think some things do not have to be said, but are implied to be true.
If you are in violation of these rules, you can either be warned,
demoted, or balzhured based on the severity of the matter.  If you feel
you have been wronged by the staff, you may post a note in an INTELLIGENT
manner and if you have the backing of most of the immortals, and at least
2/3 of the staff, you will be put back to where you were, or the
punishment will be reduced.  Any drop from an important caste will be
reviewed by the whole staff before happening (drop from maybe admin to
a normal immortal).  (Note: admin, staff, owners, this all means that
the player is level 71 or higher and/or has a caste of staff or admin.
A level 61 player is not staff)

All the rules are broke up into sections.  The first section are going
to be the "implied rules" so you know what is going on.  After that, a
list of the categories of rules will be at the end and you can goto
that helpfile to read them.  You should read every rule and understand
them.  If you think something is wrong, please contact Xerves or Stakk
about the rule and please give us the rule word for word and your
problem with it.  Thanks.

#Immortal ImmLaws~

&RCOMMANDS - PLAYER RELATED&g
*   If you are able to restore players, you are not to restore players
    at a regular interval.  Wait maybe an hour or two before doing it,
    or just contact an admin about a good time to do so.  Not going to
    get killed for this rule, but please don't abuse it.
*   Lower level immortals should not be spelling up players unless it is
    part of a quest.
*   Murdering and Slaying of immortals is allowed as long as they say it
    is ok.  Do not chase and bug immortals while they are working, or
    start something with them if they are.  Excessive playing will get a
    warning then a demotion.  Also, this rule does not apply for mortals,
    you cannot kill even if they tell you to.  (Tell them to delete if
    they want to die horribly)

                              &RCOMMANDS - IMMORTAL RELATED&g

*   Wizinvis rules - Wizinvis is to hide from players and or lower
    immortals.  You are not allowed to follow them around in silence and
    peek in on their lives unless you are staff or appointed to.  If this
    becomes a problem, wizinvis might be removed from you.  Also, for
    those who can follow around morts, you are not to pass any
    conversation back to a public or private channel unless it is 
    for IMMORTAL eyes only, and the information should be tasteful and
    useful.  Please keep in mind we want the mortals to be secure that 
    wandering eyes are not watching their every thought and action.
    Lastly, this applies to people below staff level that have wizinvis.
*   Switch, force, echo, recho, mecho, etc are not play toys and
    should not be abused.  If you are caught playing around to much,
    it can lead to a demotion or balzhur.  If you wish to test things
    out to an excessive point, leave a valid reason on a board before
    doing.  You are here to help build and have fun doing it, but not
    here just to have fun playing god against mobs.

    ok.  Breaking of this rule is an instant demotion or if very
    severe, balzhur.
*   Personal equipment is allowed, however there are rules.  Your
    equipment should not add more than 10 to ANY stat, and 2000 to
    HP/MANA/MOVE.  Also, you should keep the damage a weapon can do
    round by round down below 150.  Also, your AC on an item should not
    go over 25 for ANY REASON.  Violation of this is first a warning then 
    a demotion.  This causes problems which take time to fix and is really 
    unwarranted because you cannot die.
*   You can mset your stats to make yourself stronger.  I recommend 
    that you set HP/Mana/Move to no more than 20000 and anything else
    can be maxed to the amount allowed.  Also, gold can be set but do
    not trying to go over the max that the code does not allow you to
    set (10mil).  If you are found trying to build up your wealth by
    doing transfers, etc, you will be warned or demoted.  I take the
    economy of Rafermand very seriously and don't need a ton of money
    floating around.

2 IMMORTKINGDOM~
#Immortal ImmLaws~
#END~
When it comes to kingdom matters, unless you have some direct influence based on RPing
rules, you should avoid resolving any kingdom matters.  Instead, any matters should be
left to Xerves or anyone who has been appointed to resolve kingdom matters besides Xerves.
You should not take anything into your own hands unless the following comes up (and you are
to deal with it as mentioned).

1.  Spam killing.  This involves planting a military in a respawn room and killing players over
    and over as they respawn.  You should check to make sure a kingdom has not changed their
    respawn room to invoke this (because it is an easy way to get mobs removed).  If it is found
    out the other kingdom deliberately done this you are to ask them to remove the mobiles from
    the respawn.  If they refuse to do so, you slay the mobs.  If you aware that this group has
    been asked more then once, you slay the mobs.  If you have to slay any mobs, you post it to
    the kingdom board along with your reasons and what you slayed.
    
That is it, anything else is legal including planting a military at an entrance of a kingdom,
surrounding a respawn room with military, or putting military in every room in a kingdom.  It
is up to the players to find a way out of the situation, even if it looks unfair.

In addition, you are not to spread "ideas" to other kingdoms on what they should do about who.  You
are not to give away INFORMATION of any kind that would help or hurt the kingdom.  You are allowed
to listen to each kingdom through their kingdom channel or talk to them, but you are not allowed to
pass any information learned from any avenue.  If you are found to be abusing such rules, you will
be demoted or balzhured.  In order to keep up with current doings, it is important to have the
trust of the players to tell us what is going on, so don't abuse this trust.

&RPERSONAL - PLAYER ISSUES&g
*   You are not allowed to treat mortals like dirt.  Be kind yet
    forceful if needed, but don't go overboard.  Again, you are a direct
    reflection of our immortals, do not give us bad PR (public relations).
*   You should be even more respectful to players who are not causing
    problems.  You can talk and joke with them, but do not harass them.
    If you are having a problem with a mortal, tell a higher level
    immortal and just ignore them or ask them kindly to stop.  The mortal
    will be dealt with in a quick matter, so do not make things worse.
*   You are not allowed to give out area secrets to players even if
    bribed.  This does not include speed walk directions of non hidden
    areas or level ranges on the area (in that case tell them to type
    area).  This also includes transfers, goto, forces, or forced
    speedwalks.  If they want a public speed walk direction you are
    allowed to provide them, but let the players provide them first.
    Violation of the area secrets is an instant balzhur, and the
    transfers and forces might be a warning or demotion depending on
    the violation.  This rule will not be violated!
*   Immortals are allowed to have players, but here are the rules
    If you are going to have a character, you should not cheat for this
    character by giving equipment, restoring, sset, etc.  If this character
    is going to be part of the playing world it is best to keep it secret
    that the player is an immortal because the players tend not to like that.
    If you want to run a test char, see below rule.
*   Some immortals will be allowed to run a test character.  This player
    is public knowledge and they know it is you.  The test character is
    not allowed to group, exchange items, give gold, spell-ups, etc.

&RPERSONAL - RAFERMAND/IMMORTAL ISSUES&g
*   Sharing of password is an instant balzhur.  You are in no way to
    allow anyone else login to your immortal without Xerves's permission. 
    There will be no discussion or appeal, just not tolerated.
*   We can refuse to include your area based on many things even if you
    put 2 months of work into it.  This is not common, but your area must
    follow our stat rules and other things.  Please make sure ot follow
    whatever stat charts are out and try not to cheat things into the game.
*   If you have any ideas on what to add, please post them to the idea
    board instead of to Xerves or his email, icq, etc.  I don't remember
    well and it is much easier for me to read them off the board at a
    later time.
*   Do not excessively spam or bug a higher level immortal (not 1 level,
    but a major job position like builder to head builder) majorly.  If
    you have a request post a note or ask kindly.  We will get back to
    you soon, and if we forgot, ask again soon.
*   Not a rule but a preference.  Do not refer to Xerves as sir,
    master, honorable one, etc.  I prefer to go by Xerves and that is
    it.  I also don't like it when people do the "kiss-ass" socials.
    You know what I mean and please don't do all of that.  Shows to me
    that you are begging and is very unwanting of you.
*   You are not to advertise for us unless asked or told to a private
    group of friends on another mud or in IRL.  Such violations would
    be posting a note to mudconnector without my approval or going to
    other muds and bugging players there.  This might make us look bad
    and I don't want to explain why that happened.  If you want to make
    a homepage or put something in your email address, that is ok.
*   You are to be respectful to other immortals and staff.  Respectful
    does not mean bowing and talking kindly, but just showing some
    decency and not spamming and typing in caps.  Some of us will
    find that to be very immature and can quickly get you removed as
    an immortal.

&RPUNISHMENT RULES&g

*   You are in now way to punish a player without the permission of
    staff or an immortal who has been appointed to deal out punishment.
    This includes any type of banning, force quits, channel blocking,
    lagging, watches, logs, slaying, murdering, transferring.  You are
    allowed to talk with the player and try to calm them down though.
*   Logging of anybody (mortal or immortal) is not allowed without the
    permission of staff or anyone else appointed to do so.  This
    shouldn't be a problem because log it at higher levels though.
*   Staff reserves the right to log you without telling your or asking
    permission nor do they have to tell you they are if you ask.
    Anything found will not be distributed unless it affects your
    immship ability (meaning we will not share any discussions or actions
    of yours that is not mud related or perfectly alright.  If it isn't
    a reason to demote you or balzhur you, it will never go any further
    than the logs.  I don't personally read all logs and I could care
    less about your personal lives either).

&c&wIt is important to follow whatever rules are established when it come sto
Rping.  You can find more info over the current RP scenerios at the webiste
&Cwww.rafermand.com/rpinfo.htm&c&w.  You will find info over each race, some
background over the mud, along with history of what has been going on in Rafermand.

Now for the fun part, Rping a character.  Immortals are allowed to RP a deity
with permission of the RP council or Xerves.  This deity needs to be well thought
out and aware to the RP council and to the players if it is allowed or warranted.
Before rping, you will be brought through the current rules at the time.  Rules
might change based on time, scenarios, and just the general reaction of the players
to certain things.  It is best to always ask what is allowed before stretching any
lines.

Failure to observe rules will lead into removal of being able to RP or even balzhur
if it is abused enough.

1 IMMRULES~
#General Laws~
#END~
These are rules that immortals cannot violate against a mortal (this does not
apply for immortals).  If one of these rules are being violated, please notify
Xerves at rafermand@home.com and he or Stakk will deal with it.  It is very
important that you do this so we can right any wrongs and take care of any
problems before they expand even farther.

1.  Immortals are not allowed to slay you if they are not officially punishing
    you for something (they will tell you this, and the reasons why).  Slaying
    includes casing spells to kill you, murdering you, dropping you into a
    death trap, or any other constructive way of killing you.
2.  Immortals are not allowed to copy anything you said to them through a public
    channel, or a private channel to another.
3.  Immortals are not to give MASSIVE spellups or multiple restores to the mud
    in a set time.  If you think they are going overboard, please post a note.
4.  Immortals are not to load mobs/objs for you, or to weaken or tank a mob for
    you in anyway unless Xerves is present.
5.  Known immortal players (known imm players will be posted to a board) are not
    to help you kill a mob or give equipment (includes gold).  They can however
    spell you up.

Those are at least 5 major rules.  If you think an immortal is being rude and
abnoxious, please post a note or email about it and it will be dealt with.

2 IMMTALK :~
#Immortal ImmCom~
#END~
Syntax: immtalk <message>

IMMTALK sends a message to all immortals.  : is a synonym for IMMTALK.
~

1 'INDIGNATION'~
#Magic Cleric Assisting~
#END~
Best known as the blessing of the gods, indignation leaves a powerful bless like
spell on a whole group increasing everyone's tohit roll by 1-2 points.  This spell
can be stacked with bless and any other tohit increasing spell.
~

1 INDUCT OUTCAST~
#General Information~
#END~
Syntax:  induct  <player>
         outcast <player>
 
Induct and outcast are clan commands.  The leader and number 1 of the 
clan receive the induct commands, while the deity, leader, number 1 and 
number 2 all receive outcast.  Induct will bring a new player into the 
clan, while outcast will remove them.
~

1 INFRAVISION INFRARED~
#General Information~
#END~
Infravision is a rare gift to the dwarves that allow them to see in the night
as if they have a light.  This includes the ability to see and look at things
and see what they fully look like instead of just "a red shape is here".  
In Rafermand infravision is the same as "night vision".
~

1 'INHUMAN STRENGTH'~
#General~
#END~
Type:  Automatic Special Ability

Inhuman strength gives you the raw fortitute and strength to be able to
lift a two-handed weapon with one hand and use a shield at the same time.
This skill does not allow you to dual wielding two, two-handed weapons
however, so don't be getting that impression.  Until this skill has
reached its max potential, you will suffer a small bit of battle lag.
~

3 INSTALLAREA~
#Immortal Building BuildingSetup~
#END~
Syntax: installarea <area filename> <full area name/title>

Installs a prototype area into the mud as a non-prototype area.
The filename can be fixed with aset, (don't forget to foldarea the new name.)

Currently the builder should quit and have his/her vnums cleared manually.
(This should be fixed soon).
~

3 INSTAROOM~
#Immortal Building Resets~
#END~
Syntax: instaroom

A very useful command for creating exits on the go.  Instaroom will
generate most of the resets for you in the room.  These exits
include....

  1.  Objects on Ground
  2.  Mobs
  3.  Objects on Mob
  4.  Objects worn by mob
  5.  Objects in Objects (Containers)
  6.  Containers on Mobs
  7.  Door Resets (open/closed/locked/secret, etc)

Things to remember.....

  1.  Any object on the ground will reset, including blood, corpses
  2.  To have more than 1 like object on the ground, they have to
      be seperate vnums (a fix coming later)
  3.  If you change a door from the way you had it, and typed
      instaroom, it will load that way next time the area resets.
  4.  To save changes, must savearea (or foldarea).
~

1 INSULTS~
#General~
#END~
Syntax:  insults <target>

This is very similiar to the insult skill, but it can be used outside of battle
to insult your friends :-).  Right now these are different, but that will most
likely change in the future.

1 INT INTELLIGENCE~
#General Information Stats~
#END~
Intelligence is the stat for mental strength.

* Improves damage with certain spells
* Improves duration with certain spells

1 INTRODUCTION INTRODUCE~
#General Roleplaying~
#General AtPlayers~
#END~
Syntax: introduce [self/other target/kingdom] [victim]

Welcome to the introduction system 101 helpfile.  A few muds out there are changing
to a more RP themed version of player interaction and are changing to introduction
style systems.  Here at Rafermand, we run such a system.  For those who have never
seen it, it works something like this.

When you first enter this world, you are known to no mortal and no mortal is known
to you.  A few immortals whom are visible might be known to you, but that is totally
up to them if they decide to make their name known.  Until you introduce yourself to
someone, they will see you like this
    >>> a short, brown haired, white human is here before you.
Now, as rather informational as that is, there could be more than one person roaming
Rafermand that looks like this.  In order to make yourself known to someone you have
to introduce yourself to them.  After you do so, you can only hope they will introduce
themselves back.  Once the formalities are done, you now know the person you were just
talking to.  You will remember their name for a long period of time, but if the player
is absent from the mud for a matter of months, you will actually forget his/her name.
In addition to the introduction side of things, there is also the "rememberence" side
of it.  If you are attacked by an unknown PC, you will remember this person as MYATTACKER
or MYKILLER.  If the person assaults you enough times, you might even learn his/her name
throught he process.  In order to remove such flags from a person, you need to use the
PARDON command.  It removes all flags and returns your knowledge of that person from bad
to good.

NEXT, there is the HOOD command.  To get more information over the implications of a
cloak and its hood, type HELP HOOD.

Lastly, there are a few config options (type config) that you can set that will affect
how the introduction system works.  They are...

Player
-----------
SHOWPC - Turning this on will put a PC in front of a PC.

Immortal
-----------
SHOWASIMM - Turning this on will put a IMM in front of your name/descr
SHOWNAMES - Shows the names of everyone logged in.
UKNOWN - Universally Known.  Everyone knows who you are.

0 INVIS INVISIBILITY~
#General Information~
#END~
Only the most masterful of creatures are said to possess this secret enchantment.
It allows them to be completely invisible to the eyes of those who cannot see
the invisible.  It is not known of what possesses this talent, but it has been
passed down in legend of great unseen beasts reaking havok on a poor group of
folks.
~

2 IPCOMPARE~
#Immortal ImmPlayers~
#END~
ipcompare total
ipcompare <person> [room|area|world] [#]
ipcompare <site>   [room|area|world] [#]

Unless you have 550 players, you probably won't need this, you can do it by eye
with clones or users.  It is used to compare a user and see if he/she is using
a unique ip, if not, what clones are out there.  It also has a variable for total
to list out the total number of unique ips, and you can also use arguments to check
all in a room, area, or the default, the world.

Current jobs working in Rafermand are....

Unemployed (Value is 0)
--------------
Speaks for itself, the player does not hold a job and is considered a normal
player.  No special additional skills are given to this player.

Extractors (Value is 1)
----------
Extractors are the primary working class in the caste system.  The job is
typically reserved for the poor and low caste and provide money and a place
to live for them.  Extractors harvest everything that is harvestable in the
world.
    Help: Extractinfo

Merchant (Value is 2)
--------
Merchants are able to own shopkeepers and configure them to sell and buy
different stuff.  The keepers will keep all items over crashes and reboots
and can exchange cash and items with the shopkeeper at will.  A very
profitable job, but takes quite a bit of money to get into, plus it can

Gambler (Value is 3)
--------------
These are special shops ran by the leader that provides gambling services
to the public.  Most of the time the shop owner makes a decent profit, but
it is possible for the player to actually win if they are lucky.
   Help: Gamblerinfo

Carpenters (Value is 4)
----------
A very important class that relies on extractors and the kingdoms mainly.
Carpenters have the ability to design rooms for kingdoms or private
individuals under contract.  Carpenters can create just about any room and
even are blessed with a really good skill to add even some magical aspects
to rooms.  A kingdom without a few of these tends to go nowhere.
   Help: Carpenterinfo
   
Surveyors (Value is 5)
---------
Surveyors have the ability to survey the land for resources that the extractors
can remove from the land.  Typically an early job or a job that belongs to very
few people.  Also, surveyors can survey the current land to see how much resources
are left, very useful for telling if a mountain has been surveyed or to see how
much more tree is left to cut down.

1 JOINKINGDOM LEAVEKINGDOM KOUTCAST~
#Kingdoms Management~
#END~
Syntax: joinkingdom <num>
Syntax: leavekingdom
Syntax: koutcast <player>

Joinkindom is used to join a kingdom of choice.  You can only join player
created Kingdoms (cannot join Rafermand, etc).  By just typing joinkingdom
you will get a list of kingdoms with a few stats.  Just use the number (num)
in the num slot to join that kingdom.  Also, you might not be able to join 
if they are not allowing (will show up on the stats if they are not.

Leavekingdom simply leaves the kingdom.  You will end up back in Rafermand
kingdom.  It is possible to join the kingdom again, but soon they will be
able to ban certain names from their kingdom, so be careful.

Koutast is a high caste command that allows a person in the kingdom to
boot out a player out of their kingdom.  If the person has enough authority
that is.  The target has to be online and a player, and the player does not
have to be in the same room.

1 KEEPERINFO~
#Kingdoms Creation~
#END~
The new Keeper code allows players to own and maintain shopkeepers.  The
6 commands associated with this are these commands

  resetkeeper
  keeperstat
  keeperset
  goldgive
  keeperinfo
  pcshops

Each command has their own helpfile, and please take the time to read
them.  As for how this all works and how to obtain a shopkeeper will
be listed below.

First, to get a shopkeeper you have to do a few things.  First, you must
reach a caste rating of 7 (Merchant) and then you must request a shopkeeper
from either (in order if there are ones) the mayor of the city, a Lord,
the King/QUEEN of the land, or a high level Immortal.  Try to ask all those
people in order they are listed.  If you are granted your request, you will
be given a mob in a certain area and you will be able to get info over
him/her and do other stuff to him/her.  Any transactions you do with the
mob will not cost you anything.  In addition, because the mob you have is
special compared to other shopkeepers, your mob will keeper the items he/she
buys over reboot.  Also, you become the owner of anything bought and sold
to the keeper, and can give/take gold, set prices.  However, you have to
be careful because your shopkeeper is not invinsible and might be able to
be killed or robbed.  So asking to Train your shopkeeper might be a good
idea if you have the money.

Well that is it in a nutshell.  More stuff will probably be added as time
goes on and bugs are found, so try to check this helpfile every day for
any added commands or info.

4 KEEPERWORK~
#Kingdoms Creation~
#END~
The code is fairly complex and spans through some resets and folding functions
to make sure the items stay on the mob.  What happens is when the item is sold
to the shopkeeper, the item is cloned and stored at a vnum in the zone with the
shopkeeper.  Then, when the item is sold, the item is cloned again, but this
time back to the orginal vnum of where it came from.  Also, when it is sold, the
cloned object's vnum is deleted from the list.  As long as the keepers in the
area aren't holding 150 items a peice, there should be plenty of room for
objects as they continue to go through the cycle.

Also, everything this happens (buying/selling) the mob is reseted into the
room again, and the area folds to save the changes.  That is why all the
keepers will have a room in a seperate area that will probably be called
Keeper's Haven or something like that (probably keeper.are file), and will
be about 1000 vnums in size.  Also, a MUST, the vnum of the keeper and the
room it occupies has to be the same.  To save some coding, I coded in the
vnums to be the same, so they must be the same for the commands to work.
I hope this provides some understand, and please, do not go running your
mouth to every little person on how this works.

Keys is the master command that is used to create/manage/deploy keys in 
your towns.  Only the mayor of the town and the king/number1/number2 can
use this command.  A key is simply used to lock/unlock doors in your
kingdom.

keys list - Gives you a list of keys.  The number of the key corresponds
to the flag you set on a door

keys load - Loads up the key number you type.  The perm flag is an option
to keep the key perm (doesn't disappear upon death).  This is not recommended,
but is an option.

keys create - Creates a new key and gives it the name you provide.  You can
only have 32 keys including the master key created by default.

keys rename - Renames the key you specify

keys setdoor - Used to set what keys you can use what doors.  Just type the
direction of the door along with the key number in the flag option.  You can
provide more than one key in the argument.  Ex:  keys setdoor n 5 7 9

keys showdoor - Shows the keys that can lock/unlock the door

The first key loaded, the master key, can be used to unlock or lock any door,
the others will only unlock/lock certain doors.  It is important to remember
security when it comes to keys, because anyone can use that key to gain entrance
to the area you are trying to secure.  That is why it is a good reason not to use
perm keys unless you absolutely need to.

A skill very unique to the Swordsman, he/she will attempt to lodge his/her
sword in the target.  Apon doing so, the Swordsman will grab his weapon
tightly and kick the enemy, which will allow the sword to dislodge from
the enemy and cause massive damage in the process.  A very deadly skill

Kickdirt is a dirty *sorry* skill to blind your target for a short period

kick up at your target.  If the skill lands, your target will be blinded
for a short period of time (there is no damage though, use gouge for that).

Kickdirt is a very fast command (1 round) and tends to land more than gouge,
but it doesn't last as long.  When your target is blinded, you also have a
better chance to flee.

1 KINGDOMS KINGDOM~
#Kingdoms~
#END~
Kingdoms are the basic backbone of the Caste system and are what you would
call a basic Feudal System.  There are rulers of the kingdoms who have
pretty much complete power over the kingdom (there are still a few rules to
keep things from getting out of hand), but for most issues, total power.
You can either join a kingdom, or stay neutral and belong to the starting
out kingdom of Rafermand (which is Neutral).  Once in a kingdom, you will
have access to their city and will be under the rule of the King and his/her
rules.  It is important to find the proper kingdom for you and make sure you
are willing to follow the King and the ruling caste of that Kingdom.  In
the beginning there will be only a few kingdoms, but later on, hopefully, there
will be a few more.

You can use the command 'showkingdoms' to get a list of Kingdoms and it will
provide some basic information, and then you can use the "joinkingdom" to join
a kingdom.  The king of the kingdom or others who have the power to remove you
can ask you to leave or boot you out at any time, so it is a good idea to
carefully choose your allies and do not anger them.

If you think that all the kingdoms that exist are not for you, you can try 
to start your own kingdom. However, to start a kingdom required a rather 
deep pocket of 400000 gold coins, and it requires a bit of work to obtain this
much gold by ones self.  Once you have the gold, just goto a spot in the 
Kingdom wilderness you want to start your kingdom and type startkingdom 
<name> 

That is about it for now, below is a helpfile with a command list for kingdom
use, check it out if you wish (not all commands are available for everyone).

Syntax: klog search <keyword> time <start time> <end time>
Syntax: klog prune time <time/-1>
Syntax: klog prune lines <lines/-1>
Syntax: klog clear now

Used to show the log of doings in your kingdom.  If you meet the
MinReadLog value, you can read the log.  If you are the king or a
staff level immortal, you can also clear out the log and prune it.  

There are a lot of changes to the klog system in 2.1 to make it
a lot better yet able to maintain a good robust usage for it.
The first options are just a list.  You can get a linecount of
everything in your log, or you can specify how many lines to
show from the start or a certain range.  If you have more than 400
or so lines in your log, you probably want to search it by groups
of 400 or so.

You can also search by time if you want to see what happened during
a certain time.  The parsing for the time looks like this
   Feb 18 2:50 2003
   2:18:2:50:2003 
You use military time for this thing, so 2 PM is 14:00.  You can
use this to get a list of what happened in a few hours or a few
minutes.

Next is a search by type.  There are catagories things are logged
under.  They show up in the log as such
   [create         ]
You can do a type search like this and it accepts line arguments

Then probably the most useful search, the keyword search.  You can
use the keyword search to search for any keyword in the description
in the log (the right most part).  Keyword searches take line and
time arguments.

Lastly the prune options.  You can either prune by time, lines, or
both.  Lines is pretty easy, you just specify the number of lines
and at certain intervals in time it will prune out the oldest
log entries for you.  If you set the value to -1 it will disable
this feature.  The time feature uses the following expression
   7 days 12 hours 15 minutes 5 seconds
   7:12:15:5
You can use it to to clean out a log entry if it is beyond the
time specified.  The time used here is RL time, so if you put in
1:0:0:0 it would clear out anything that is over a day old.  Setting
the value to -1 will disable this feature.  You can see the current
settings in townvalues.

You can use the logsettings command to filter what types are entered
into the log.  If you are sick of seeing 1000s of extraction messages
when you dump 80 units of wood, just turn that type off (HELP LOGSETTINGS)

The mysterious Krundi Style is tought to only the best.  It actually
increases the tohit padding on a blow.  It can increase this value by
up to 2 (tohit padding is the 3, 5, 7 on stab, slash, and bash that
counts toward making a partial hit).  By increasing this padding you
have more chances to land a blow.

as bears or wolves, but unknown figures that appear to be made out
of plastic and carry weapons of unknown origins.  Many of citizens of
Rafermand beleive that some unknown entity has landed in the lake and
created a hell hole out of a once peaceful forest area.  Also, a man

1 LASTNAME 'LAST NAME' FAMILY HOUSE~
#General Information Players~
#General Newbie~
#General Roleplaying~
#END~
Syntax:  lastname <new lastname>

Due to our introduction system and use of a fame system, each player now has a
last name.  Each character when it starts out picks a unique lastname.  Lastnames
will show up if you aquire enough fame, or the target knows you.  Once you are in
the game, you can also join another family or house by having someone in that house
accept you in by using the offername command (HELP OFFERNAME).  Those in the same
family will have the lastname.  

You cannot pick a lastname that is a person's firstname, is on the reserved list, or
has illegal characters.  You can be denied a lastname in the authorization process and
be forced to change it.  If you are asked to change it after that, you will have to
relogin and change it at the login process.

-1 'LAW BOTS'~
#General Laws~
#END~
Bots are script ran characters that typically are ran without the player
actually being in control of the Bots.  Bots are useful for certain
things, but certain Bots will not be allowed here.  These bots are
as follows.

Allowed
---------------
Eating/Drinking/Quaffing Scripts
Extracting bots(extracting materials from the map)
Text triggers (leveling, arrivals, etc)
Healing/Spell up Bots (they say something, they get healed)
* Note - certain kinds of healing bots are disallowed, see below

Not Allowed
-------------------
Leveling Bots (You get triggered by a string and you go pillage an area)
Killing Bots (Almost same as above, but it involves gold/path laying, etc)
Arrival to a room Bots (like Recall messages, etc, gets spammy quick)
Fully unattended Healing/Spell up Bots (characters you don't play but leave
around for people to ask for spellups, heals)


The above list is not all of the bots that exist for use, but are a general list
of common ones that came to my mind.  A general rule of thumb is do not create a
bot that will violate any other rules and do not create a bot that will dominate
an area and slay everything in it so no one else gets a chance.  Also, if your bot
is caught misbehaving even if you did not intend it to do so, you still will be
held responsible.  If you are going to make a bot, be responsible enough to watch
what it is doing every once and awhile and make sure you are leaving the challenge
and fun intacted.

a complaint to the gboards (help gboard) and it will be addressed.  If
you refuse to quit, you will be silenced or worse.

Finally, these rules do apply for immortals too, you are held to a higher
standard than the mortals because you represent me just like you would
represent an employer.  I don't expect you to be perfect, but I expect
you to behave.  This kind of an offense is a warning, but I have demoted
people for it before, so don't push me or the council of complaints.

&WWarning:  &GArguing with or flaming immortals on channels _WILL_ get you
silenced or worse, and this may extend to your other characters as well if
you push the matter.  Rafermand has gboards and councils to contact with
complaints and doing it in a harsh and wrong way will only get you in
more trouble. Also if ANY immortal asks you to stop using profanity then stop.
Even if you think that word(s) are not that bad just do not say that word(s).
If you want to sing or use some harsh language then do it in a telepath to your
friend or on say but do NOT use a public channel. That means everything from chat
to music. Avatars must also obey this rule when speaking on avtalk. Avatars should
follow the same rules for avtalk as they should and will for the other main channels.
Again no matter if it is a level 51 immortal or a level 75 immortal, if they ask you
to stop using that type of language or to change the subject matter, then please do
so.

.
&GDo not bring aggressive mobs into or near Rolen camp, as when their charm
wears off (either naturally or by attack) their aggressive nature will
return.  Also do not bring aggressive mobs into areas which are lower in
level than the area from which the mob originally came.  You can use the
'areas' command to check an area's level.  See 'help charm' for more.
~

-1 'LAW CHEATING'~
#General~
#END~
.
&GCheating is a very serious offense and subjects _all_ characters involved
to a slay, purge (loss of all equipment), freeze, balzhur deny or even a site ban.

What is considered cheating?
 - exploiting (intentionally using) a bug to gain equipment or gold
 - intentionally causing the system to crash
 - intentionally duplicating equipment or gold
 - knowingly accepting illegal equipment (see above) from others
 - attempting to duplicate equipment or gold -- * even if not successful *
 - using or making profit from equipment that was accidentally duplicated
 - using gold that was accidentally duplicated

What also should be reported?
 - Mobs that are set wrong (mobs with too much gold)
 - Any bugs or typos
 - Anything that just looks out of place.

Cheating hurts the game, and every player in the game.  Protect yourself
and report any bugs you find, and inform the Immortals if you have strong
cause to believe someone is engaged in any of the above.

If you find yourself with duplicated items, gold, or have found you a
little bug, please report it to the immortals.  If there is a problem
with a mob, we do ask that you tell us, and if you are caught plundering
the mob, you might be punished or you might not depending on HOW bad the
error is.  If a mob is giving a million gold, you better damn well tell
us, if you are caught, your gold will be removed and probably something
worse.

                             __NOTE__
Bug reports sometimes get rewards and sometimes don't.  Please don't ask
for rewards for bug reports.  We are developing policies for people who
help with bugs, but asking for levels, a different class, massive amounts
of gold or QP won't be tollerated.  We do like your help, but our rewards
will be small, not something that will change the balance of the mud.

1 'LAW CORPSES'~
#General~
#END~
With the recent changes to the way corpses work, a new law is being entered
in reguards to eq on a corpse.  Due to the fact that instead of having
corpses taking eq with them when they rot, corpses will not drop the eq
on the ground instead.  This creates the possibility that a player's corpse
could rot and you could collect the eq in it.  The following rules apply for
such a situation.

1.  You cannot camp out on a corpse unless it is a fullloot area.
2.  Camping out in or near a corpse in a noloot-anitem area with the intent
    of killing the player to prevent corpse retrieval will not be tollerated.

If for some reason you die in a kingdom protected area and that land is not
fullloot, the rules here do not apply.  This pretty much only includes dieing
in another kingdom's town that does not belong to you.  The owners do not have
to let you back in to collect your corpse if they do not want to.
~

-1 'LAW DELETION'~
#General Laws~
#END~
As stated in the delete help file, deletion of a player is a deletion
of a player.  You will not be given the player back at all.  In order
to delete the password must be required and does not happen accidently.
Don't ask for anything back after you deleted even it was RARE quest
equipment or removed equipment.  Nothing will be given back, NOTHING.

In rare cases I give back deleted players, but don't expect it after
deleting every time.
~

-1 'LAW HARASSMENT'~
#General Laws~
#END~
.
&GHarassment is giving a person unwanted attention, whether you perceive it
as negative or positive attention.  If a person is made to be uncomfortable
by your attention or comments, you are harassing that person.  If a person
asks you to desist in talking to them or performing socials on them, and
you do not stop, you are harassing that person.  If you act in an intimate
manner to a character, without their permission, you are harassing that
person.

No form of harassment is tolerated in Rafermand.  We especially frown upon
unwanted comments or actions with a sexual nature or explicit content.  If
you do not have an intimate relationship with the person, whether in real
life or within Rafermand, you should refrain from using suggestive actions
and/or comments.

If you are caught harassing another player in any way, you can be silenced,
helled, frozen, denied, and/or site banned.  Harassing another player is a
serious violation of the rules and will not be permitted.  If you choose
to harass an immortal, you are choosing to be removed from the game.

NOTE:  If you are asked by an immortal to answer a question even if he/she
is visible or not it is who of you to answer the question.  A simple
reponse is all that is needed.  If an immortal has to ask you more than
2 or 3 times for an answer and you are there to hear him/her, you might
suffer punishment depending on the circumstances.

~

-1 'LAW IMM REQUESTS' 'LAW IMM REQUEST'~
#General Laws~
#END~
.
&GIt has became rather clear to me to post this rule because players
don't know what immortals can and cannot do for them.  Below is a
list of what not to ask an immortal and what you can ask.  If it
is listed in the not ask, typically there will be a small note on
possible costs or special items that can be given for the request.
All immortals reserve the right to deny these special requests and
spamming the immortals with requests can result in silence, helling,
freezing, banning, deletion, you name it, the immortal can do it.

Note:  This is in regard to mortals asking immortals, mortals can
ask anything, but still remember, you are not to harrass them.

Not Allowed Requests:
1.  Specific locations of any area, room, equipment or stash of
    gold that hasn't been released on the player page.  You may
    ask a general location of an area if it is not on a map or
    ask if we can release where an object/mob is area wise.  We
    do not have to tell you the location if we choose not and
    continued asking once we have told you no will be a warning
    and then a silence or worse.  We are busy and don't want to
    be nagged.
2.  You may not ask for a restore unless you have a restore token.
    Restores are done when we feel like it or when we feel someone
    might need it (you are better off hinting than blatantly asking).
3.  We will NOT, NO WAY, give you back anything that was lost when
    you did a character delete.  This included everything, NOTHING
    will be given back.  Delete is delete, if you have a problem with
    this, post a reasonable argument on the complaints board (help
    gboard)
4.  You are not to ask for specific directions to a certain area.  If
    you want this, ask another player or start looking at hompages.
5.  Do not request us to up/lower a mob or make a certain type of item
    just for you.   If you feel we are lacking a certain type of item
    in the game, use the complaints or idea board.
6.  Don't ask for restrings (item renaming) unless you have restring
    tokens or have the proper glory for a restring.  The whole thing
    costs 1000 glory or 100 per line or 500 for anything over 4 lines
    of look descriptions
7.  Do not repeatively ask for quests, if you ask a lot we might silence
    you or refuse to do a quest for awhile.  Quests are done to allow
    you to have fun and get rare stuff, but we do it as an addition not
    something that is a MUST every day.
8.  Do NOT ask for a class change no MATTER how much time you have put
    into the mud, no matter what you have done for me, no matter
    ANYTHING.  I will not change your class or race even if you hand
    over a billion gold or QP points.  The first person to send me
    a $100 in American Money (cash, not a check) will get an avatar
    mage with no equipment *l*.

Allowed Requests:
1.  Corpse Retrievals if it was caused by a bug or you are a true newbie
2.  Ask about any new changes to the mud, but not details like where
    they are or how much it costs, or to ID it, or auction it, etc.
3.  You may ask for an UPLIFT ONLY if you are about to die.  I allow
    the immortals to uplift you a lot of the times if you are stunned,
    but this will change as we get more players online.

NOTE:  There might be additions later, and the rules for harassment still
exist here.  If we say no, we mean NO.  Repeative asking for a favor or
an answer can lead to a silence or worse.  Please be patient and kind if
you ask an Immortal for something.

7 LAW LOOTING~
#General~
#END~
This is not really a law, but more of a guideline for looting when
a group is fighting a multi-player fight.  Often poor looting guidelines
are set and this can be used as a good start.

A command called roll was put into the game to aid in this process.  With
this command players can roll a value from 1 to 100 and the game will spit
out a number.  You can use this to decide who wins the prize, or prizes.
Typically, the standard is the highest roll wins.  If there is a tie the
people who tied roll again till there is a clear winner.

In case of multiple loot, you roll on each item and the winner of 1 item is
not capable of winning any more loot unless the loot is large than the party
(there are 5 items and 4 people).  You can pass on any item at any time and
even go back if needed.  If everyone passes on an item twice, it is free for
the taking by any individual in the group without a roll.

Lastly, if you already possess the said item (on any character in your account)
you should pass on the item in favor of someone who does not have the item.  In
addition, if you are in a group with clear roles, you should pass on any item that
does not benefit the character you are playing at the time of the looting.
~

1 'LAW LOOTING'~
#General~
#END~
There is no clearly defined rule for looting and this really is not
a rule to follow, but more of a general guideline for looting in
multi-player groups.  If you cannot think of your own format to follow
it might be easiest to use this guideline so any question of looting
can be addressed and straightened out

First, the roll command was introduced a few months back.  The main purpose
of this command was for deciding on who should loot.  It can be used to roll
a 1d100 dice (or any other set of numbers, 1-100 is the default).  The value
range the target choose along with the result will be displayed for everyone
in the room to see (for this reason you should not rely on someone to tell
you what the result was if they died, everyone should be in the room so there
is no argueing).  The winner of the roll wins the item in quest.  Read below
for more detailed scenerios.

If more than one item is involved, everyone rolls on the items in quest, only
change is once you won an item you cannot roll on another item UNLESS there are
more items than party members (5 items and 3 party members).  Any member of the
party can pass on any item if they want.  Only 2 rounds should go by, if the
whole party passes on 1 object twice, the object is up for free loot from anyone
in the party.  Once everyone has won an item, everyone can then roll on the items
in question.  It is a good idea to roll on the items everyone wants first to get
those out of the way.

Lastly, if your character or any character in your account already owns the item
you are rolling on, you should pass on an attempt to roll for an item.  If this
holds true for everyone, then everyone can roll on the item.  Also, if your party
is setup into certain roles, you should pass on an item that does not help with
your roll.  If you are the tank that doesn't cast, rolling on a high mana object
should be passed on in favor of those who can use it.  If everyone passes on an
object for this reason then anyone that can use it can roll on it.  This rule is
probably the most confusing and "arguementive" of all of them, it might be a good
idea to drop it if you are having problems deciding.

NOTE:  A party member consists of anyone "actively" present during a kill.  This
includes anyone that has died and is not currently in the area, has been there for
till the end rather it is tanking, healing, rezing, etc.  If a person goes LD they
have 5 minutes to get back on or they forfeit their chance at an item.  Anyone can
pick up said items as long as you know they are not NODROP/NOGIVE and hold on to them
till the winner is decided.  Once this format is setup, it is not up to anyone to
change it or decide *hay I don't like Player X so he/she does not get the item*.  If
things are going to be fair, let the dice decide the winner.

-1 'LAW MULTIPLAYING'~
#General Laws~
#END~
We are a no multiplaying mud.  This means you should not have more than
1 open connection to the mud at any given time.  Failure to follow this
rule will lead to warnings at first, and then freezing, banning, or anything
else we feel is warranted.

                 ___LANS___
If you are on a LAN and going to have multiple people playing on
the same network, you are to contact Xerves or any admin or staff ranking
immortal before logging more than 1 character.  Often we will watch you
to make sure you aren't multing characters through this LAN to get
around the 1 player limit.  If you are caught abusing our rules
on LANs, the whole LAN address will be banned from use.  Mainly,
if you are on a LAN, don't give out your password to other members
unless you trust them, if they try to log you on so they can use
4 characters and are caught, your LAN access will be denied and
maybe your character froze.

Pkilling is allowed, there are only a few rules and they are posted.  See
law pkill for more info
~

-1 'LAW OBJECTS'~
#General Laws~
#END~
As it comes down to it, the rule is possession is 10/10 of the law.  If you
leave an object laying around on the ground, it is open for anyone to pick it
up and take it.  If you give an object to a player to hold, it is now their
object and they have the right to keep this item if they so wish.  Be careful
who you trust because we will not sort out this mess.
~

1 'LAW PKILL'~
#General Laws~
#END~
Rafermand is considered an "open pkill" environment because everyone is
setup so they can pkill, there are no nonpkillers or pkillers.  However,
there are certain zones/rooms that are safe from pkill, and different
levels of pkill (Safe, Noloot, An Item, Fullloot).  It is important to
know the rules of pkill, and what you can do to avoid pkill if you want
to (however, it is hard when you get in higher levels).

Also, it is useful to know what kind of pkill room you are in, you can use
the command pstatus or put in the %p variable in your prompt.

With that, please read the following help files.

-1 'LAW REIMBURSEMENT'~
#General Laws~
#END~
Lately there has been some problems with reimbursement for crashes so
here are the rules for crashes and some tips.

First of all, SAVE often, I know crashes can be seen as my fault, but
things do happen and I am not perfect.  If you save often, you will
find yourself losing less during a crash.

Below is a list of things that will be reimbursed during a crash and
what will not.  If you don't see it on a list, please go ahead and
ask about the rules on it.  As for who to ask, ask anyone who is
staff level or higher to be reimbursed.  If no one is online, post a
note and we will tend to you as soon as possible.

Will be reimbursed...
1.  Special "quest" items that are lost during a crash.  Don't expect this
    to happen immediately because we will be checking to make sure you
    aren't cheating us.  If you are, you will be punished. (see below
    for instanced were it will not be given back)
2.  If your pfile is totally whacked up, we will put a new one in and
    will try to get you back any special quest items that were lost
    in between now and the last backup.  After that, we ask that you
    do any work you did to get yourself caught back up.
3.  In a freak accident or testing with an immortal, if something scraps
    it will typically be loaded up again for you.  If you are told no,
    don't harass the immortal, post a note to the complaint board or
    the complaint council.

What will not be reimbursed....
1.  Anything due to a DT even if it was a quest item.  Any time you hand
    something out, you take the risk of losing it.  If we find you are
    handing out special "quest" items to other people and it is lost during
    a crash, sorry, it won't be given back.  If it is your player, we will
    spend time investigating to see if it was truely "lost".
2.  Any minor item that you had.  If you have mithril equipment and lost a
    bunch of bronze stuff, go get off your lazy ass and go get it again
3.  WE WILL not give items out if you DT or lose an item, get it scrapped,
    disarmed, etc.  If you didn't lose it to a crash, no reimbursement.
4.  Skills will not be reimbursed unless it is said so by immortals.  This
    will only be the case if there was a bug or a mistake by an immortal.
5.  Gold sometimes will not be given back, if it is skill related, please
    consult an immortal due to many things can happen.
~

1 'LAW RESPONDING'~
#General Laws~
#END~
It is important that if an immortal asks you a question and if you
don't reply and asks you again that you reply to the immortal.  Trying
to avoid the immortal who is asking a question can get you punished by
maybe a silence or a helling or just a warning depending on the situation.

If the person asking is invis you are still to answer, but it might be
a good idea to ask if it is an immortal first.  If they say yes and we
find out later they were lying, the player will be dealt with for lying.
If all else fails, ask the one doing the talking to transfer you if you
don't beleive it is an immortal, that should be enough to prove it is
an immortal.

I find this law not to be a serious violation compared to others, but it
is just a law of respect, if an immortal asks, I am not saying you need to
jump up and say yes sir, no sir, just be kind and try to respond promptly.
~

-1 'LAW SHARING'~
#General Laws~
#END~
I discourage sharing of characters, and here is why.

1.  I have had people delete a shared pfile because they were pissed off at
    their friend at the time.
2.  Some how someone gets ahold of the password and strips everything off the
    character and gives it to another characters.  Probably a result of number
    1 or revenge of number 1.
3.  It confuses the immortals at times.  We like to know who is playing who.

When it comes to such things, ownership of the password is ownership of the
character.  If you let your friend use your character and he/she changes the
password on you, guess what, you are fucked and we won't do anything about it.
I don't like sharing, but some people go ahead and do it.  Just make sure to
do it with someone you trust and don't come whining to me if something goes
wrong.
~

-1 'LAW SPAM'~
#General Laws~
#END~
No, we are not talking about a luncheon meat here.  Spam is the repeated use
of a phrase, command, or channel that causes screen scroll for others.  Not
only is spam considered rude, but excessive screen scroll can interfere with
the game play of anyone seeing it (not to mention combat situations).  The
game will also tell you to PUT A LID ON IT and force-quit you after the 20th
repeat of a single command

It is also considered spam to use the same phrase over several different
channels.  The use of all-caps can also be considered spam.  Only use
capitals to add emphasis to key words in a sentence.

Moving a large number of items into and out of a container in a crowded,
non-store room is considered spam.  Using multiple characters to chat the
same message at the same time is considered spam.  Making charmed mobs
or pets to cause screen scroll through movement or orders is considered
spam. ANYTHING that causes excessive or irritating screen scroll can be
considered spam.

~

-1 'LAW STAKE'~
#General Laws~
#END~
You cannot stake a mobile (call a mobile).  This has to do with the change
in being able to steal kills from a player.  Again, it is considered rude
to stake a mobile that someone else has already staked, but it is not against
the general rules, just frowned upon.
~

-1 'LAW STORES'~
#General Laws~
#END~
Stores put up in the immortal based cities/towns will have pacifist mobs (should
have pacifist mobs).  If they are not pacifist, you are to tell an immortal and
do not kill the mob.  Abusing this will lead to warnings and taking of money and
even deletion if it is abused.

1 LEARN~
#Skills~
#General Information~
#END~
&w&GSyntax: learn <mobile> [skill/group] [mastery]

This is the main command that allows you to learn a new skill or spell.  In order to do
this you must find a trainer.  A trainer is easy to spot because they have &w&W[TRAINER]&w&G
before their names.  Once you find a trainer, you may type this:

  learn <mobile name>
  
This will give you a listing of all that this trainer teaches.  Once you do this, there are
a few things you have to take into consideration before you can learn from this trainer.

1.  In order to learn beginner, you need to meet the requirements of that Tier (HELP TIER).  Tier
    1 requires nothing, but Tier 2-4 requires you have skills/spells in the Tier below the one you
    are trying to learn at a certain mastery.  To learn what Tier 2-4 require, type 
    listgroups toadvance <group> (HELP LISTGROUPS).  For starting out, you can only learn Tier 1
    spells or skills.  You can find out what ones are available by typing &c&wlistgroups allgroups&w&G to
    find a group and then using &c&wlistgroups <group>&w&G to look at the skills/spells in that group.
    The ones that are &w&YYellow&w&G are Tier 1 spells/skills (HELP TIER for what the colors mean).
  
2.  There will be a monitary requirement to learn.  Cost is based on the mastery of the skill/spell you
    are trying to learn (HELP MASTERY) and any taxes applied by the kingdom.
    
3.  In order to advance to Novice you need 4 points in the skill/spell.  Expert needs 7 and Master needs 10.

4.  If you are learning Beginner and it is a spell, you will need a spellbook.  You can go find a spellbook
    mob and use sbook to purcahse the book (HELP SBOOK)
    
Once you have learned the skill/spell you wanted, you will be able to get better at it by using it.  All
skills/spells increase in power as you use it more often.  You can see your strength of skills/spells by
using the &c&wskills&w&G command (HELP SKILLSCOMMAND).

1 'LEVEL' 'LEVELS' 'CLASS' 'CLASSES'~
#General Information~
#END~
&c&wRafermand simply doesn't have levels or classes, instead a unique advancement system is used. 
Character achievement is completely up to you, the player, there is no level or class restriction 
regarding the use of spells, skills or equipment.  You can pick any skill or spell your soul desires, 
but there are restrictions to how far you can go with it (HELP SKILLS).  Some skills and spells 
affect each other, which means, advancing in a certain spell could result in losing some efficiency 
in another spell or skill.

In a sentence, your abilities increase when you use them, and decrease when you dont.

This simple rule applies to every aspect of character achievement, for example:
* Fighting and getting damage will slowly build up your hitpoints.
* Casting spells will build up your mana as well as your intelligence.
* Movement is improved by the new Endurance ability, the higher your endurance, the less moves it 
  take you to move around.

To find out how well you are doing in all these aspects, use the gscore command (HELP GSCORE) to see 
abilities and stats progression, and the skills command (HELP SKILLS) to see spell and skill
progression.

#Combat~
#END~
You have 4 limbs, 2 arms and 2 legs.  If you get a limb removed, you will face
certain challenges in battle (also if they are damaged, smart mobiles will target
them and break them again)

arms - If you get a limb sliced off you lose any items on that arm (gauntlets, 
weapons, shields).  You cannot use that hand to wield anything, and that slot 
is free to be attacked with no armor block bonus.

legs - If you get a leg sliced off, you lose ability to move well.  If you get
both sliced off, you cannot move at all (you either need healed, dragged to
a healer, or die to get your limbs restored).  Also, you will lose whatever greave
was on that leg.

To restore a limb you can either die (which will bring you back to 1 point of health
in all 4 limbs), goto the limb healer in Rolen camp and use the restorelimb command,
or have a cleric cast the regenlimb spell on you.

Syntax: listgroups allgroups
Syntax: listgroups <group name>
Syntax: listgroups <skill name>
Syntax: listgroups toadvance <group name>

Listgroups is the main command used to find out what skills/spells are available to you.  Since there are
no classes in Rafermand, all the spells/skills that are available are seen with this command.  It is possible
to be able to use everything listed in listgroups, but the system is setup so you can only really dominate in
a few areas, or be average in a handful.

listgroups allgroups will show you all of the available groups and what sphere they belong to.  A sphere is
one of the main "sections" of skills.  AS of this helpfile there is Warrior, Thief, Hand-to-Hand, Cleric, and
Mage.  Each one of these spheres has a few groups in them.  Each one of the groups has a few skills or spells
available that you can learn at trainers (HELP LEARN).  For more info over spheres and the dirty functions of
the skill system, check out (HELP SPHERES) but be ready for a rather detailed reading

listgroups <group name> will give you a listing of skills and spells available in each group.  You will notice
there are colors for each skill/spell.  This reflects what tier this spell/skill belongs to (HELP TIER).  You will
also notice the color, this is also explained in (HELP TIER).

listgroups <skill name> will allow you to find out what Sphere/Group a skill/spell belongs to.

listgroups toadvance <groupname> is used to tell what is required to learn spells/skills in a certain Tier.  In
order to learn Tier2 spells/skills, you will need so many Tier1 spells/skills at Novice.  This will give you
all this information along with how many you need.  It is very important to understand the Tier system if you
plan on having access to the more advance skills/spells in Rafermand.

1 LODGING LODGE DISLODGE DISLODGING~
#Combat~

&YSyntax:  &G&Wdislodge

Now, you do not lodge in a cabin, this is a system that now works with
the projectile system (possibly comming to the normal combat soon).  If
you shoot a projectile (sharp one, arrow, bolt), if it lands a hit it will
lodge itself in the target's body in either the arm, leg, or ribs.  Each
tick the lodged item will do damage to the victim, also their healing powers
are nearly sucked to nothing.  However, the victim will randomly pull it out,
so you cannot shoot at a mob and come back in 2 hours to find it dead.

If you happen to get shot yourself, you can use the command dislodge to
remove the arrow from your body.  Just like when a mob does it, it will do
a good deal of damage to you to remove it, but if you do not remove it, you
will slowly die.

3 LOG SNOOP~
#Immortal ImmPlayers~

Syntax: log   <character>
Syntax: log   all
Syntax: snoop <character>

LOG <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like FREEZE, it is a permanent character toggle.

Certain commands (PASSWORD) are protected against LOG.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

LOG ALL logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots.

SNOOP shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time.
The input from the player will be displayed with a header of the players 
name and a percentage sign (i.e. Mudder%)
SNOOP yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.
-- Do not snoop people being intimate. <i.e. Mudsex, voyeurism, etc...>
-- Do not repeat information learned in snoop casually, especially to mortals
-- Only snoop a person talking to a higher level Immortal with the higher
   Immortals "Express Permission".
-- If a higher level Immortal begins communication with someone you are
     snooping, inform that higher Immortal immediately of the snoop.
-- Any incidental references learned in snoop should be disregarded
    ** For example, you hear someone is having a mud affair, it is not
    ** important to the reason you are snooping.  Do not judge or pass
    ** on information learned in this manner.
-- "Spot check" snooping of lower level Immortals is part of being a higher
   level immortal.  All Immortals may be snooped at any time, for any reason.
-- Do not snoop for the purpose of gaining information for personal reasons.
-- Being an Immortal is a privilege and a job.  Snoop is a tool to assist
   you do your job properly.  Snoop is neither a toy nor a right.

0 MAGIC~
#Magic~
#END~
The magic system here in Rafermand goes along with our unique skill system.  It
is important to understand each Group in the two Magical Spheres of Cleric and
Mage.  The 6 groups are as follows : fire, air, water, earth, energy, divine.  In
each group, you have 4 tiers of spells.  The 1st tier being the weakest and the 4th
tier being the strongest magic known to Rafermand (help tier).  Along with the tiers,
each group has certain strengths and weaknesses.  Below is some info about 
the spells in each group.

Fire -   One of the more physically powerful groups.  Fire in the mage set is used to damage
         equipment with its steady heat and attack small to large groups of foes with destructive
         spells such as Fireball.  When it comes to resisting Fire spells, there is a 1/2 damage
         save against the attack spells.  When it comes to the cleric side, Fire is used mainly
         in such spells as animate dead, group healing magic of fortify, and the ever popular 
         protection of sanctuary.
       
Earth -  Another good physical group.  Earth has the ability to bring great damage if used for
         its destructive measures.  On the flip side, the protective side of Earth offers some of
         the best protections by ways of armor, shield, and stone skin.  Along with that, Earth
         boasts one of the most powerful Mage spells in the game, Antimagic Shell.  A very
         powerful spell that helps to reduce the effectiveness of magic against the target. On the
         other side of the group there is the helpful healing spells of cure poison and blindness.
         In addition, those Clerics who master this group have access to one of the most destructive
         Clerical spells in the game, sacred blast.  Those who wish to use this group faces 1/4 of
         damage if a save is made, but can damage equipment
        
-------Continued in MAGIC2-------   
~

1 'MAGIC BANE'~
#Magic Mage Offensive~
#END~
A very powerful spell by the affect it can have on a character by one who has mastered its
use.  Magic bane places a magical curse on the subject making it a lot easier to land spells
for their full affects on the target.  Unlike curse, magic bane cannot be revoked by a remove
curse spell.  Those who are masters of this spell find it much easier to inflict damage on
the target with their spells
~

0 MAGIC2~
#Magic~
#END~
Air   -  Another useful group, and the most powerful on one level.  Air offers a lot of unique spells
         that aren't available anywhere else.  Such spells as wizardeye, uplift, and know enemy are
         of huge benefit to any adventurer who wants to make his/her name known in the world.  In
         addition, there are the benefits of summon and portal, which can be used to travel around
         the world in a rapid fashion.  The attack spells in the Air group are the most powerful in
         all of Rafermand, but they suffer a negate (no damage) save.  This means it is either full
         power or miss with such spells
        
Water -  A rather balanced group to choose.  Water is essential toward living in the world, and some
         of the spells offered in this group are essential to survival too.  Starting off early with
         a simple spell like create spring can come in handy when there is a lack of water to drink.
         In addition, the Cleric side of Water offers the 3 basic healing spells, which come in handy
         to the beginning adventurer when it comes to restoring health on the fly.  In addition to that,
         there is the offering of breathing underwater with aquabreath, the ability to see far away
         distances with farsight, and the ever powerful unravel defense.  Saves versus spells in this
         sphere cause 1/2 damage
        
Energy - A very powerful group on a handful of different levels.  Mages and Clerics alike who have mastered
         this group are respected and feared alike because of their power to do many different things.  Energy
         is the most difficult group to Master, but the payoff for dedication is quite evidant to the Experts
         and the Masters.  Energy is the only group that contain spells that can drain health from the target
         and give it to the caster.  The spells are a little weaker than their counterparts in the other groups,
         but they contain this hidden strength.  In addition, the clerics of this group have access to the
         damage spells available to clerics.  Lastly, there are the rather beneficial spells of enchant weapon,
         true sight, pass door, recharge, knock, and weaken.  On top of that, Energy contains one of the most
         sought after spells in all of Rafermand, sanctify.  Besides the draining spells, there are straight
         damage spells in Energy and all these spells including the draining ones are 3/4 damage if saved
         against, so they offer the most damage if saved against.
         
Divine - A cleric only group.  Divine contains some of the core spells essential to any cleric.  Ranging from
         bless, harm, and heal up to the most powerful healing spell in Rafermand, power heal.  Divine is harder
         to learn than any other group, but the payoffs are good in the short list of great spells available to
         the cleric.

is needed to be done.

1.  Use makekeeper command on the person of choice.
2.  The room and the mob MUST have the same VNUM to work correctly.
3.  The mob needs to be non prototype and have the CASTEMOB flag on it, and if
    told by another immortal, the pacifist flag.
4.  Need to use the shopmake/shopset to create a normal shop for the
    keeper.
5.  Need to instaroom and foldarea the mob.  Make sure the mob IS NOT prototype
    and it HAS the castemob flag on it.
6.  Tell the player to type keeperstat and resetkeeper to make sure the commands
    are working ok.
7.  Inform them to read all the helpfiles over the keeper commands.  Also inform
    them the buy0 - buy2 and level0 - level1 will not work till they are ALL set
    to something besides 0.
8.  Remind them they can transfer gold using goldtake and goldgive
9.  Tell them they cannot give items to the mob, but have to sell it to them.
    Remind them this does not cost them or the mob anything.
10. After that tell them to resetkeeper and explain to them to use it after doing
    a money transfer or doing a keeperset
11. Make a note at 9003 and don't EVER switch into the keeper.

That is the process in a nutshell.  You can view the helpfile KEEPERWORK for
more info on how exactly this all works.

3 MAKEMOUNT~
#Immortal Building BuildingMobs~
#END~
In order to create a saveable mount, a few things are required.  First, 
you will need to flag the mount mountsave and mountable.  Second, you
will need to set some values on the mob.  Those include.

m2 - selling value of mob
m4 - Additional HP added to level
m5 - Additional Movement added to level
m6 - To Level modified (100 is 1, 200 is 2, 0 is 1).


 Note: this might not work for lower level imms and if it does work, you
will need to change an attribute to make it save (like str).

After you are done doing that, place the mob in the room right after the
mount shop's vnum and instaroom.  Then go back to the mountshop and type
list.  After you have done this, post a note telling the others this
mount exists.  If you need to know values to set the mob, ask Xerves.

1 MAKEROOM ROOMSTAT SHOWKINGDOMS~
#Kingdoms Creation~
#END~
Syntax: makeroom yes
Syntax: roomstat
Syntax: showkingdoms [all]

makeroom is the command used to create a room that you can work with out
on the map.  The room has to be in your AOC (help AOC) and you must
possess enough rooms left in your kingdom (type townvalues to see how
many rooms you have left).  If you are go on both of those issues, you
will need 4,000 lumber in your town to get the job done.  Once the
room is done, you can use the build command to do other things to it
(HELP HOWTOBUILD)

roomstat is rather simple.  Stand in a room you can edit and type roomstat.
It will show you all the stats in the room.

showkingdoms shows you some data for both your kingdom and its towns.  If
you are not in a town, it just shows you all the kingdoms in the game.  &WIf&w
&Wyou are an immortal&w, you can use the all option to show more details over
all the kingdom and their towns.

The build command has two layers of use.  The king has the ability to set
a certain caste limit for those who can use terain changing commands to
build roads, etc.  Also, there are the carpenter commands that allow for
the actual use of build to create new rooms, etc.  Carpenters also can use
the terain changing commands too.

Syntax:  makewizlist

Resyncs the wizlist file with the current immortal list.
~

1 MANABURN 'MANA BURN'~
#Magic~
#END~
SEE SORES
Syntax:  manaburn

A very useful skill that focuses one's energy into causing pain toward someone
else.  Manaburn works a lot like sanctify and it stacks with sanctify.  Once
the skill is activated you will see the increase in damage.  Again, this skill
increases with use in battle.
~

1 MANABURST~
#General~
#END~
Syntax:  manaburst

Manaburst is the next step up to manashot.  Manaburst is the only area attack
spell (well it is a skill) that is available outside of the Wizardry sphere (not
counting earthquake).  It will do a great deal of damage to everything in the
room, but will cost a decent amount of mana to use.
~

1 MANAFUSE~
#General~
#END~
Syntax:  manafuse

Manafuse is the ability to channel damage taken into mana.  The skill needs to
be activated to work and it will last for a period of time like most Spiritual
skills.  Once on, any damage taken (magic or nonmagic) will increase your mana
by at least 1.  Your skill in manafuse is increased by actually taking damage
and converting it into mana.
~

1 MANAGEN HPGEN 'GREATER MANAGEN' 'GREATER HPGEN' 'DIVINE MANAGEN' 'DIVINE HPGEN'~
#General~
#END~
Syntax:  c 'managen' <target>
Syntax:  c 'hpgen' <target>

Managen and Hpgen spells grant the target increases regeneration in the ability
to gain hp and mana.  This spell works much like the way the regeneration of a
bed does and multiplies against furniture regeneration.  There are 3 levels of
strengths of these spells and each level increases the rate of regeneration (so
does gaining points in each spell).
~

1 MANAGUARD~
#General~
#END~
Syntax:  managuard

Another powerful skill, managuard uses one's mana to absorb physical damage.
Unlike manashell, the damage is only cut in half.  Couple this will sanctuary
and stoneskin affects, it will quickly cut down damage.  Like all the other
skills in this sphere, it is mainly learned through use, so get smacked
around some.
~

1 MANASHELL~
#General~
#END~
Syntax:  manashell

Manashell is a powerful ability that allows you to form a protective shell around
you that will absorb any damaging magic casted against you (it will not stop
poisons or any other toxins).  Any damage spells casted against you will be
absorbed against your mana.  If you don't have enough mana, it will absorb all
the damage it can handle with your current mana. 

Like most of the skills in the Spiritual line, this is not an automatic skill,
it must be activated to use.  Once activated you will actually gain points everytime
it is used to absorb magic.
~

1 MANASHIELD~
#General~
#END~
Syntax:  manashield

Manashield acts much like the other shield lines do (ex: shockshield).  It will
put up a shield that will damage the target everytime it attempts to hit you.
This shield is a very good way to add extra damage in combat and since there is
no mana cost to activate it, it is about as close to free damage as you can
get.  Like the other skills in this sphere, you will learn this lovely skill
each time your manashield hits, so it won't take too long to get this one up.
~

1 MANASHOT~
#General~
#END~
Syntax:  manashot victim

Manashot is a powerful ability of channeling the inner energy into a blast of
energy that will cause some serious pain to the target.  Manashot works by
using mana like a spell (but it is a skill).  The damage counts as magical
damage, so enemies that are resistant/immune to it will still be able to
lessen the damage.  There is no bonus/penalities for the skill though, so
there is no mana saved for fairies or lost for ogres.

Lastly, it will autotarget your enemy if you use it in battle.
~

1 MANATAP~
#General~
#END~
Syntax:  manatap

A very useful skill that allows you to collection mana and then pump it into
your mana pool pushing it over the maximum.  This allows you to have a bit of
extra mana than you would normally have (for perhaps a big battle, etc).  Once
your mana is past full it will start ticking down so it is important to use the
mana or it will be wasted. 

Eventually you will be also able to store the extra mana in jewelry that you have
added gems too (once support is coded in)

3 MAPAT~
#Wilderness~
#END~
Usage: mapat <startx> <starty> <endx> <endy> <sectortype> [keep sectors]
Keep Sectors has a limit of 10 sectors, values only.

Mapat is used to do lines or blocks of wilderness.  You can also use mapat
to change the "background" sectors of an area if you use it right.  This
means say if the sectors aren't a road, mountain, or other sector, it will
be a plain.  Later you can change this from a plain to perhaps a forest
using this command.

mapat is fairly straight forward, just supply the x and y range and the
new sectortype.  The keep sectors argument is used to ignore certain sectors
in that block.  It would be used in the example listed above of changing
plains to forests in an area full of roads, mountains, etc

#Wilderness~
#END~
Usage: mapedit sector <sector number>
Usage: mapedit save <mapname>
Usage: mapedit exit <vnum>
Usage: mapedit exit map <mapname> <X> <Y>

Mapedit is used to modify values on the Overland (Wilderness).  The two main
commands used to do this is mapedit and mapat (HELP MAPAT).  Mapedit is
used to do it 1 coordinate by 1 coordinate.  Mapat is used to do it in lines.
There is also the blockmove command (HELP BLOCKMOVE), but it is only used
in rare situations where you need to literally copy a block of an area to
another area.

Mapedit is also used to create exits to an area.  The proper way to create
an exit is as such.

1.  Find the spot you want to exit to be on the wilderness.  Next type this
       mapedit exit <vnum>
2.  Go into the exit to the area.  Then type this
       redit exit <dir> 16000
       redit exflags <dir> overland
       redit excoord <dir> <x> <y>

~

1 MAPFIGHTS~
#Wilderness~
#END~
While roaming around on the wilderness, you will eventually be attacked by
something.  General rule of thumb is the more people you have grouped with
you, the better you are off.  Once your party gets so big though, more mobs
will start to come for you, so that can be either a good or bad thing depending
on what you want.

In addition, if you are in unsafe areas (such as not on the road), more mobs
will be loaded.  In general, the more moves it takes to move in that sector, the
more dangerious that sector is for loading mobs.  It is possible to load 4 to 5
times more mobs in certain sectors than others, so be careful.

Once you are in a fight, the only way to really get away is to run away from the
mobiles enough that they stop chasing you or flee into an area.

2 MAPLINE~
#General~
#END~
Syntax:  mapline <dir> <start> <end> <new sector> <till sector> [skips]
   dir:  0 - North, 1 - East, 2 - South, 3 - West
   
Used to fill out a map, particularly after you outline it (such as a new
continent).  You choose the direction you want the fill to happen and you
choose the start and end value (so if you are going east you are going
to provide the north most cooridnate and the south most coordinate).  Then
you provide the sector you want to fill in, then you provide the sector
at which to stop at.  The skips is optional but you can actually skip the
till sector any number of times (default is 0).  

The main use as mentioned is outlining.  You perhaps create a shoreline for
the continent then you sit at the very north side of the continent and you
provide the west most coodinate then the south most coordinate.  Then you
provide the new sector (say field) then provide the till sector (shoreline
since that is your outline).  It will then run south and fill till it finds
that shoreline.

Syntax:  massgoto <low vnum> <high vnum>

command is used to create a room and massgoto just runs the goto
command for each vnum, thus creating the room if it does not
exist.

&w&GThis concept is rather easy to understand actually.  Just think of each
mastery as a different power level of a skill or spell.  If a person
has a Beginner Mastery (1) he or she will be weaker and less efficent than
an individual with a Novice Mastery (2) if they both have the same amount
of skill points.  As it comes to advancing Mastery, you need to find a special
trainer (has &w&W[TRAINER]&w&G in front of his/her name) and use the learn command
(HELP LEARN).

If you already have more than the limits listed you will be allowed to
keep them, but anyone else after this time will be forced to keep this
limit (by the code not the admins).

2 MCREATE~
#Immortal Building BuildingMobs~
#END~
Usage:  mcreate <vnum> [cvnum] <mobile name>
OR:     mcreate <vnum> [cvnum] auto <level> <name>

Creates a new mobile.
A prototype monster will be created with the selected vnum, and
set up with the plainest of default values.  A material image of the magical
prototype will appear before you, for you to futher modify with MSET

You need to specify the vnum of the mob (the vnum will be your mob range
given to you to build with) along with the name of the mobile.  The cvnum
is an optional value to create a copy of another mob.  Here are some examples

mcreate 2100 evil ghost (Creates mob with a vnum of 2100 called evil ghost)
mcreate 2101 2100 scary ghost (Copies everything from 2100 into 2101 and calls it scary ghost)

Lastly, the last option allows the auto setting of stats.  You use the auto option
along with the level of the mob.  The level is a number from 1 - 130.  You can find
the stats that will be preset on this mob by taking a look at (HELP MOBCHART).  If
you need to do this again later, mset also has a similiar option (HELP MSET)

.
&gYour mental state is your current frame of mind, and how clearly and
realistically you view your surroundings.  Mental states can be affected
by prolonged combat, hunger, thirst, or poison.  If you are affected by
one of the above for a period of time, your mental state will begin to
deteriorate, and you will not view your surroundings as they truly are.
You may begin to hallucinate, or become too lethargic to function, and
your general abilities will be affected.  In extreme cases you may
collapse from exhaustion or enter a delirious coma.
 
To restore your mental state, you may need to rest (resting and sleeping
will speed your recovery), eat, cure whatever poison afflicts you, etc.
Note that if you are malnourished your state will &wnot&g improve, even with
sleep, until you have fed and/or quenched your thirst.
 
Your mental state is by the text line in 'score' which describes your state
of mind (You feel great, etc.)  The 'group' display contains a less accurate
reading of your and your group-mates' mentalstates as well.

  5) Set the Value3 (V3) from the table in HELP WEAPONTYPES.
 
&G Now the wielded weapon is done, but you need something to fire...&W
  1) Create a shootable object, for instance, an arrow.
  2) Set the itemtype to 'projectile'
  3) Set the wearflags to 'take'.
  4) Set the projectile values from the HELP ITEMVALUES table.
  5) Set the V3 to match the V3 on the firing mechanism you created.
 
Don't forget to finish the items with weight, cost, long, short etc.
You now have two objects in inventory which are ready to fire.
Lastly, you may create a quiver for certain objects. To do this,
set the itemtype to 'quiver', and use v0 to set its capacity.
Be sure not to set the capacity too high, as quivers should be small.

When it comes to how intelligent a mobile is when hitting a target, it
falls into what values you set for intelligence and wisdom.  Below are the
scales and what will happen if a mob fits into it  (note they will only fit
one scale)

Int < 8 - Mobile will only target Body

Int <= 11 - Mobile will target a random body part

Int <= 14 - Mobile will target unequiped part or random body part (Also at this
            level the mobile will correctly grip a weapon)

Int <= 17 Wis < 15 - Mobile will targed unequiped limb, next target weapon limb, next
                     will target random body part.

Int <= 17 Wis > 14 - Same as above but on the random will only target a limb. 

Int <= 21 Wis < 18 - Target empty limb, then target a body part if the diff is 3 or better,
                     then target weapon limb, Lastly target random limb.

Int <= 21 Wis > 17 - Same as above but a diff of 1 or better. 

Int >= 22 wis < 22 - Target empty limb or target best possible limb to hit.

Int >= 22 wis > 21 - Target empty limb, next target a hurt limb, next target a damaged piece of 
                     equipment, lastly target best possible limb.

An insane spell only available to those who have devouted their path to that of
Energy.  Created originally to destroy ores and water, molecular degeneration causes
the target to warp and start to break down at the molecular level.  If this can be
used to destroy ore and water, you can only imagine what it does to the body of the
poor target.  To add injury to insult, the cunning mages found a way to tap some of
that energy to restore their health.  Molecular Degeneration is quite possibly the
most altrocious of all spells available to those learning the ways of the arcane.

1 MORAL MORALE~
#Kingdoms~
#END~
Morale is a value that ranges from 1-103 and it is represented in your townvalues screen
Every month, you go up for consideration for a Moral Increase/Decrease/Nochange.  Once
you reach a certain moral, you will either increase or decreate in size.  The values
are such.

Size 1 = 1           Size 2 = 6         Size 3 = 12
Size 4 = 18          Size 5 = 24        Size 6 = 30
Size 7 = 42          Size 8 = 54        Size 9 = 72        Size 10 = 100

You advance to the above sizes by reaching the moral value listed, you decrease in size by
reaching the value below the ones listed.  Moral gain/decrease has a few factors, they are
as followed.

1.  Double Consumption.  This is turned on by default, they consume twice as much of the
    resources as they need, this increase moral.
2.  Taxes.  The higher the taxes, the less moral, the lower the taxes, the default tax for
    a town ranges from 6 to 9 percent.  Leaving it at 7.5 is a fairly safe bet.  You can
    only increase taxes once every Game Year (Kingdom or Town)
3.  Number of Units in service.  If your town size (HELP TOWNSIZE) is 4 or greater, if you
    go over a certain number your moral chance will lower.
    
The chance to gain is a -100 to 100 roll and it starts at 0.  Double Consumption gets you
positive gains, Lower Taxes gets you positive gains.  If you meet Double Consumption on
all resoures, you will gain a moral point unless taxes or units is decreasing your chance.
Not have enough food to meet Single Consumption is an automatic reduction of moral and
not meeting the other resources will drop your chance down quite a bit.  

Lastly, you can change from No/Single/Double consumption on Food/Lumber/Stone/Coins with

the townvalues command (HELP TOWNVALUES).  You can change these at any time.
~

1 MORGUE~
#General~
#END~
Syntax: morgue retrieve yes
Syntax: morgue cost
Syntax: morgue newbie
Syntax: morgue quest

You can only use this command at the morgue (the healer in Rolen camp is
the current location).  This allows you to retrieve a corpse from a quest
while it is still ongoing.  This will however cost you QPS.  If you would
rather wait for your corpse to materialize at the morgue after time runs
out, you can do that and save some QPS.

Lastly, the amount of QPS increase as your Sworth does, so for a newbie
it might be only 1 QP, for a veteran it is going to cost a few more.

Recently added is the ability to get a CR from any area using the newbie
argument.  This will get all your corpses in the game and deposit them in
the room with you.  There is a rather large cost of 5 of your MAX HP, so
use this as a last ditch effort.  YOu have to have less than 100 hp and
this will only drop you down to no more than 20 HP.  If you think this
is steep you might ask a player to drag (HELP DRAG) your corpse so you
can get to it safely.

Added a bit later is the ability to get you corpse when you have more than
100 HP.  It is done using the retrieve option and costs 5% of your MAX HP.
There is a 15 minute wait before this can happen to allow anyone to loot
your corpse if they so choose (to avoid abuse).

0 MOUNT DISMOUNT~
#Wilderness Mounts~
#END~
Syntax: mount <mob>
Syntax: dismount

Mount is a skill, which allows you to mount certain mobs.  Being mounted
on a mob cuts down on movement points that are used whenever you move.

New water sectors allow a person mounted to traverse them without damage
from drowning.  If you are in an area where your movement points begin
to drop suddenly and/or you begin to lose hps <hitpoints> quickly, you
should try to mount immediately.

NOTE:  Please read (HELP MOUNTS) for more information over mounts.

1 'MOUNT FOOD' 'MOUNT NOURISH' 'MOUNT NOURISHMENT'~
#Wilderness Mounts~
#END~
Certain foods called chow can be used to feed your mount to restore movement
and in the case of special chows, hp.  Chows cost a little bit more than
normal food because they are carefully made to be the best mix of different
food types to provide the maximum amount of energy for your mounts.  With
enough chow, you can move your mount across the whole Wilderness.

1 MOUNTDEATH~
#Wilderness Mounts~
#END~
When a mount dies, it now will return to the normal recall place in
Rafermand.  You can recall to get your mount back, or simply walk back
to Rafermand and fetch it.  Also, when a mount dies its endurance is
dropped down a point or two.  So, you won't lose your mount if it dies, 
but you will lose some endurance, so it is important not to attack it 
or blast it with a spell.

Note:  This does not count in arena combat.

1 MOUNTS~
#Wilderness Mounts~
#END~
It is now possible to buy mounts that act like pets and will save when you
save and quit when you quit.  In addition, just like pets they will follow
you and you can order them.  Also, one of the new and cool features of the
new mount system is that you can now improve certain mounts.  The mount will
slowly gain more endurance over time, just like players do.  More endurance
in a mount means they can move farther and carry your huge amounts of equipment
with them at the same time.

There are a few tips for people with mounts.
* If you lose your mount, recall, it will show back up at recall.
* Don't use area attacks like fireball or earthquake.
* If you have a mount, try to use full names of mobs you want to attack
* You can restore movement to your mount with mountfood
* It is possible to trade mounts at certain unknown shops.
* If a mount dies it loses endurance (HELP MOUNTDEATH)
* There are special mounts out there that are better in battle, magically
  blessed, and even can fly!

1 MOVEMENT MOVE 'MOVE SYSTEM' ENDURANCE~
#General Movement~
#END~
Move is the the point value that is used for movement.  Move always stays at a flat 1000
points, but it is affected by 2 other things, Endurance and Weight.  Endurance is a point
value that is used to measure how far you can move without becoming winded.  You start
to get winded once your move value reaches 500.  Higher endurace will make it longer to
get to 500.  In addition, if you are carrying a lot of weight in the form of inventory
or on your body in the form of armor and weapons, it will also make it easier to
get winded.

Before you get winded there are two levels, above and below 800.  Below 800
causes you to suffer a bit of movement lag (nothing like below 500) and
above 800 causes no lag.  (NOTE:  These movement lag rules do not apply to
someone who is mounted)

Once you reach 500 points, you will start to get messages about breathing increasing and
it will become harder to move and longer (lag).  If you reach around 75 points, you will
pass out and enter a stun like state for a few seconds.   It is always a good idea not to
go below 200 points.

If you are looking to travel far distances, it is a good idea to stick to roads (HELP WILDRNESS)
or even better, go purchase a mount (HELP MOUNTS).

In addition, you will also get tired while in battle, certain commands require a lot of
energy to use, and mana requires a lot as you start to build up toward the higher level
spells, so it is a good idea even for a mage to stay well shaped.

What Increases Endurance
-------------------------------------------------
* Moving around (Won't gain endurance while on a mount)
* Battle

What Decreases Endurace
-------------------------------------------------
* Time
* Death

1 MOVEMENTCOMMAND~
#General~
#END~
Syntax: movement <#>

Allows you to change the default "X arrives from the south" instead changing
it to something like "X struts in from the south".  This works in both normal
areas and in the wilderness.  This will now work if you are mounted or flying.
~

1 MOVEREQUIREMENTS~
#General Movement~
#END~
Each sector you go into requires a certain amount of movement to move
into.  The movement is either subtracted from you or the mob you are
mounted on.  In the wilderness, movement is about 5 to 7 times more
than the normal requirements while in the city, so it is important to
carry mount food or have your mount full of movement.  Also, it is
important to save movement by moving down sectors like roads or path
that require a lot less movement than something like hills or forest.

To get a list of sectortypes and the degree of movement it required to
move into the sector, use the showascii command.

2 MPDEPOSIT MPWITHDRAW~
#Immortal Building Progs Mpcommands~
#END~
Syntax:  mpdeposit <amount>
Syntax:  mpwithdraw <amount>
 
This command orders the mobile to deposit or withdraw a specified number
of gold coins from an area.  These can be used in conjunction with mpat
to tell the mob which area to withdraw/deposit money in.
 
Example:  mpat 21000 mpwithdraw 5000000
 
This would cause the mob to withdraw 5 million coins from the new Rafermand
area, as that is the area vnum 21000 is in.
 
If no mpat is used, the mob will withdraw or deposit the gold from the
area in which it is located at the time.

#END~
Syntax:  mpgive <item name/vnum> <target>

This command controls a mob's ability to use a modified form of wizinvis.
 
Use 'mpinvis' alone to toggle the invisibility.
 
Use 'mpinvis <level>' to set the level at which the mob will be invis.
 
Mortals under the mobinvis level of the mob will be unable to see the mob
when it goes mobinvis; they cannot see it with any spell, it will be
completely invisible to them.
 
Be warned, however, that its programs will still function as normal, the
mortal will simply see a 'someone' if it performs an action or an echo
that they see, just as if a wizinvis immortal performed the action.
 
Also be warned that at the present time, area attacks _will_ hit a mobinvis
creature even if it is invisible.

specified skill/spell/language to the specified amount.
 
It cannot train a character in a skill/spell/language the character does
not have as a part of its class and that it does not already have as a

Slays the target.
~

2 MPSLEEP~
#Immortal Building Progs Mpcommands~
#END~
Syntax:  mpsleep <# of ticks>

Used to perform a mpsleep or stop in a mudprog.  It will force the prog to 
stop # of ticks (a tick is 1/4 of a second).  The prog will continue to sleep
till it fires or the target leaves the room.  It is best only to use mpsleep
commands on mobs and use it for interaction purposes because it doesn't work
or work all that well with objs or rooms (hence the use of invis mobs).
~

2 MPSTAT~
#Immortal Building Progs Mpcommands~
#END~
Syntax:  mpstat <mob/mobvnum>
 
Mpstat will display all of the mobprograms that have been written for the
specified mob.  If an instance of that mob exists in the game, it can be

~

1 MPTAKE~
#General~
#END~
Syntax:  mptake <item name/vnum> <target> [destroy]

Takes the item from the player.  There aren't really any checks here
so this is a powerful command.  It is still a good idea to use a iscarrying
though to check on the status of the item.

Lastly, the destroy text is optional, it will junk the item instead of putting
it in the inventory (saves the mpjunk command afterwards)
~

2 MPTEACH~

1 MPVALUE~
#General~
#END~
Syntax:  mpvalue <target> <value>

Used to set a trigger value on the player.  The value is not saved on
the character and can be used on both a mob and a pc.  The value is typically
used inside of a SINGLE program due to this nature, but if you are confident
nothing else will be increasing it you might be able to spread it out.

The only other thing is value, it can take either a number or a +(number) or
a -(number).  Just setting a value with no sign will set the value to that
number, adding a + before it will add that value to the current value and
- would subtract it (pretty much the equivalant of += and -=).  
~

2 MSET~
#Immortal Building BuildingMobs~
#END~
Syntax: mset <victim> <field>  <value>
Syntax: mset <victim> autostat <level>
        mset character on

MSET sets the properties of mobiles. If a mobile has the PROTOTYPE flag,
modifying an instance of this mobile will also modify the index mobile, which
all other instances of the mobile are based on.
 
MSET ON will lock you onto a particular mob/character. Once locked on, all
mset commands will imply 'mset <character>'. Hitting enter while in MSET ON
will give you an mstat of the mob/character you are working on. To get out
of MSET ON, simply type the word DONE. Example:
 
        mset gracca on
        long A large hulking figure stands here.
        sex 1
        done
        
AUTOSTAT is a value of 1 - 130.  It will autoset the key stats (hp/mana/tohit/etc)
for you.  You can get an idea of the values set by looking at (HELP MOBCHART).

Lastly, there are quite a few options available.  See (HELP MSETOPTIONS) for a brief
rundown of what each option does.

pen in your inventory.  Mail can only be addressed to real players, or 
'all'.  There is a charge for reading and taking mail.

To post mail to more than one party, use 'note to <name> <name> <name>', etc.
Note that any of the named parties can remove the mail before the other
parties get a chance to read it.

Mushclient has a small config issue that is not very useful.  By default
all mxp links are defaulted to a blue color.  This is nice, but color is
used in commands like listgroups to show the Tier.  If you want to make the
color show up along with the MXP syntax, simply follow these directions.

Goto World Properties under the File Menu.  Open the Appearance tab and then click
on MXP / Pueblo.  There will be a checkbox called "Use costom link colour".  It is
by default checked, simply uncheck it.  This will fix the blue link color problem

1 MXP~
#General Information~
#General Newbie~
#END~
This mud features the use of the mud protocal called mxp. What does this 
mean, well here is a brief description and why I want to support it. 

Mxp is a markup-language, much like xml and html. It allows me to put in 
tags like you see in html and add in some custom tags like you can in xml. 
This also allows me to create links and all you need to do is right click 
on an object/mob/word to get a list of actions you can perform. This means 
you do not even need to know the syntax, you just right click on it, get a 
list of options, and then choose the one you want to use. This makes things 
more newbie friendly, and can enhance the play experience for all. 

There are other features of mxp that can be used, but that is one the 
primary reasons to use it. If you want to play around with mxp, this is 
what you need.... 

Mushclient - www.mushclient.com (get the most recent version)
Zmud - www.zuggsoft.com (Need z6.22 BETA or higher)

Both of these clients are Win32 (windows 9x, NT, 2000, etc). There is no 
linux client out there or mac, and I do not suppose there will be one any 
time soon. In addition, it is important to get the latest version of either 
of these clients because the protocal is still in its infancy and is being 
developed more and more. So to get the most out of the features, you need 
the newest client. If you are a cheapskate and cannot afford the $25 US, 
you can always use Mushclient forever without paying a dime (even though 
you can register it) 

NOTE:  There is an mxp command used to turn on/off some functionality.  The
helpfile is (HELP MXPCOMMAND)
~

1 MXPCOMMAND~
#General~
#END~
Syntax:  mxp mapwindow [on/off]
Syntax:  mxp mapwindow [close/open]

Mxp is the command used to turn on/off certain parts of the mxp protocol used
in Rafermand.  Due to the limited amount of clients that can use mxp, mxp
functions are turned off by default.  You can use this command to enable certain
functions and others are done automatically depending on what client you
are using.  The following commands are available atm:

mapwindow (Zmud 6.62+ only) - Used to send the output of the wilderness map
to a window.  This will popup the window for you and turn on the function for
you.  Once on, the map data will be sent to the window for you.  It will
also resize itself when needed, this resizing will cause the window to return
to its default position of upper-right hand corner.  Things that cause a resize
are enhancements/dehancements of sight like darkness and wizardeye.  The map
is also opened/closed when needed (like entering/leaving the map).  The
following options are available: 

   on - Turns it on and loads up the map
   off - Turns it off and removes the map
   close - Simply closes the map
   open - Simply opens the map

Suddenly out of nowhere, a hideous beast appears, bringing with it the
horrible smell of brimstone, death and decay!

The demon gives you the most evil and spine tingling sneer that makes you
fall to your knees, and release your bladder...

...shredding you to a bloody mess!

Mercifully, everything goes black as it moves its widening maw towards your

You feel yourself leaving your body... rising up into the air, you feel

You float high into the heavens... a vortex of ever-changing curved beams
of colored light swirling around you faster and faster...

Your soul is bursting with emotions you can barely conceive...
You feel a burning inside... both cold and hot... a tingle of electricity
grows into a powerful buzzing surge jolting through every inch of your body.

A strange chorus of voices begins to sing indecipherable and long forgotten
words... the singing grows louder and louder... a million voices as one.

You feel yourself losing touch with reality... and all goes quiet.

oceans, seas, lush valleys, dark caverns and twisted passages...

Beams of light break through your skin, one at a time, then more and
more until the light is almost to bright to bear...

As your squint your eyes, you perceive a vision of great beasts of wonder,
dangerous and unnatural fiends, pixies, faeries, tribes and clans, peoples
of all kinds, ancient forgotten artifacts, weapons of vast untapped powers,
crystal balls, magick rings, staves, wands, rods, arcane tomes of untold
secrets... your mind is bursting with inspiration...
 
You sense a new, reborn feeling of unlimited potential and power...
In your hands the power to build and create these visions for yourself!

The bright light from your hands fades away... but strange faint glow
remains always.

  Example: A new player named Pete has his name denied. To change his
  name to 'Joe', Pete would simply type: &YName Joe&W.
 
When choosing a name, please try to choose one which is both medieval
and unique. Good names help add to gameplay and will allow you to forge
an identity for yourself. Simply put, your name should &YNOT &Wbe:&G

 - Similar to that of any Realms Immortal, major mob, or equipment.
 - Significant in history, mythology, or any religion.
 - Comprised of various capital letters, such as 'BrACkkA' or 'CORTO'.
 - Comprised of ranks or titles, such as 'Lord' or 'Master'.
 - Composed of singular descriptive nouns, adverbs or adjectives,

 - Any combination of singular descriptive nouns/adverbs or adjectives, as
   in 'Metaljacket Heartbound Earthstone or Softheart'.

&WPlease keep in mind that names which were authed in the past do
not validate current name authing. Above are the guidelines
which all immortals follow. In addition, they may have their own
reasons for denying your name. The final determination as to the

and is NOT subject to debate or discussion. If your name is denied,
simply follow the guidelines and try a new one.

#END~
This is a change to make the near death situation both faster and a lot more
recoverable than it was in the past.  It use to be if you hit -11 hp you died.
Also, if you were less than -2 hp, you would eventually die too.  This has been
changed a bit so it could go either way at a certain point.

Stunned  (-3 to 0 HP)    - You will recover to 1 HP
Incap    (-11 to -4 HP)  - You could go either way, you could recover or die
Mortal   (-15 to -12 HP) - You are going to die unless you get some aid FAST!
Dead     (-16 HP)        - You are dead....

In this new system, it is quite possible you could sit in Incap for a very long
time if you keep bouncing back and forth in that range.  If for some reason you
ever just want to die, you can use the command giveup to do this (HELP GIVEUP).

1 NECKCHOP~
#Combat HandtoHand~
#END~
A rather simple knife strike to the neck.  It doesn't sound like much, but if used
by one who has mastered this attack, neckchop offers a vital attack to the neck that
can cause death in some cases.

&w&CSEE ALSO:  &w&WHANDTOHAND
~

1 NECKPINCH~
#Combat HandtoHand~
#END~
A rather simple attack to pinch an open flank of skin that can been seen in the neck.
It causes a nasty sting on the target and in some cases can be lethal if a vital spot
of the neck is pinched hard enough.

&w&CSEE ALSO:  &w&WHANDTOHAND
~

1 NECKRUPTURE~
#Combat HandtoHand~
#END~
A nasty finger strike to the next in a small area of the neck that causes the blood
flow in the neck to rupture and cause a great deal of damage or even death.  Neckrupture
seems to be the favorite of some experts because it is rather bloody in nature.

&w&CSEE ALSO:  &w&WHANDTOHAND

1 'NECROMANTIC TOUCH'~
#Magic Cleric Hindering~
#END~
Syntax:  c 'necromantic touch' <victim>
 
This spell drains hitpoints from the victim and returns some to the caster.
~

1 NERVEPINCH~
#General~
#END~
Syntax:  nervepinch [target]

A very useful skill that can be very useful against any enemy (note:  enemies with
massive amounts of hp have a very high resistance to this skill).  Once the nervepinch
lands, the target will attack with 1/2 the normal speed of before.  The affect is
temporary lasting a few seconds to a handful of seconds, but the attack takes very
little time to attempt (1 round) and is highly effecient in reducing damage taken
from melee.  The affects, however, are not stackable so the first neverpinch must
wear off before another one can be applied.
~

1 NERVESTRIKE~
#General~
#END~
Syntax:  nervestrike

A very powerful skill for those who wish to exceed in the art of combat. 
Nervestrike works a lot like stun, but think of it as a more stealth version
of it.  Nervestrike only takes 1 round of combat to attempt and when it lands
you get the same results as a stun.  The thing the sets nervestrike ahead of
stun is that enemies cannot be immune to it.  However, landing it against those
large beasts of enemies can be a difficulty feat.

-1 NEW_DEATH~
#General~
#END~
&R...Everything begins to fade to block.  You feel yourself leaving your body.
Rising up into the air, you feel more free than you have elter felt before...

However, before your deity comes to collect your soul, you feel a strange
pulling sensation as strange and colorful mists swirl around you...

You suddenly awake half dazed in what appears to the the Rolen Academy.  All
around you people are watching as you appear to return from the dead.  Many
people are gasping that you are still alive and are praising their gods.

As you look around, you notice though that you are without any equipment, just
your gold.  Type 'help death' to get more information over death and what is
involved with your corpse.

1 NIBURO~
#Combat HandtoHand~
#END~
An amazing strike only known to the master of the arts, it is rumored it is some kind
of flying strike where the attacker seems to appear to stay in the air for ages pummelling
the target senseless (literally).  Beyond that, nothing else is really known, nor is it
really known if this is what the attack even does.

   You will start out in an auth area (hopefully) and will have to
   wait a few minutes to be authorized.  If no immortal is on, just
   wait about 10 minutes and you will be authorized if you want
   to play.  Also, you will find that you have a book in your

1 NOBEEP~
#General Communication~
#END~
'Syntax: config +nobeep

Nobeep blocks people (Immortals and Mortals alike) from beeping you.
BEEP sends a small little sound byte to the other player whom you beep.
They will receive a small message saying who beeped them, and a small
little beeping sound will play on their computer (pending if they can
hear it, or have sounds setup).  Please, do not abuse BEEP, and you can
also set it up so you will not receive beeps (config).

A mana node is a special room in a kingdom that can be used to hold mana
for a kingdom.  Players can either draw or dump mana into this node to
be used.  In addition, it will be used to do special "things" in a kingdom.

As of this helpfile writing, mana nodes aren't setup correctly yet.

1 NOFINGER~
#General Information Players~

'Syntax: Config +nofinger

This stops players that are a lower level then you from fingering you.

Finger gives you a short list of information about the specified player,
such as his/her title, level, and last time they connected. It also shows
their web homepage and email address if they have chosen to specify one.

You cannot get finger information on someone if they are immortal and 
you are not.

1 NOHUNGER NOTHIRST~
#General~
#END~
Syntax:  c 'nohunger' <target>
Syntax:  c 'nothirst' <target>

Both spells stops the wanting of food or water for the duration of the spell.  The
only thing you need to watch is actually getting full (specially if you are quaffing
potions).  These are good spells to use if you know you won't need to quaff or
eat anything for a long period of time.
~

2 NORESOLVE~
#General~
#END~
Syntax:  noresolve

Toggles the name resolving status for the game.  Name resolving is translating
the IP address of the player to a host address (ex: 11-211-112-160.client.insightBB.com).
An Ip address would be 11.221.112.160.  It is easier to look at a hostname than an
IP address.  This was provided early on because the resolving componenet had problems
on different providers, but the name resolver addition by Samson has fixed this
problem.

USAGE - 'note (command) [number or text]'
   (command) can be any of the following:
    List, Read, Write, Subject, To, Show, Post, Remove, Take, Date.
   [number or text] can be left blank, be a number, or be words
    depending on what (command) you use.  Usage is explained below.

LIST - Lists the notes you can read. List [number] lists all the notes
 including, and after [number]. You must be at a note board to List.

          'note list 10' shows notes 10 and later on the board.

READ - Displays the contents of [number]. You must be at a note board to
 Read, and you must specify a [number].
 example: 'note read 5' displays note #5.

WRITE - Puts you in an editor where you can write a note. You must be
 holding a note, and have a quill in your inventory to Write.
 example: 'note write' puts you in the editor. See Help EDITOR.
 
See Also Help Note2
~

1 NOTE2~
#General Communication~
#END~
SUBJECT - Sets the subject line of a new note to [text]. You must be
 holding a note, and have a quill in your inventory to set the Subject.
 example: 'note subject Hello World!' sets Hello World! as the subject.

TO - Sets the recipient(s) to [text]. ALL means all players. IMMORTAL
 means all immortals. You must be holding a note, and have a quill.
 example: 'note to Harakiem' sets Harakiem as the note's recipient.

SHOW - displays a note you are holding.
 example: 'note show' displays the note you're holding.

POST - takes a note you're holding and posts it to the board you are at,
 so others may read it.

REMOVE - erases note [number] from a note board. You must be at a note
 board and be the note's author or an immortal to use Remove.
 example: 'note remove 12' removes note #12, if you're its author.
 
TAKE - similar to 'Remove' but places the note in your inventory, rather
 than completely erasing it.
 example: 'note take 10' moves note 10 to your inventory from the board.

DATE - similar to 'list' but replaces who the message is to with the
 date that the note was written.

Syntax: notitle <character>
Syntax: noemote <character>
Syntax: notell  <character>
Syntax: silence <character>
Syntax: unsilence <character>
 
NOTITLE, NOEMOTE, NOTELL, and SILENCE are used to muffle other characters, by
preventing them from setting their title, emoting, telling, and using
channels, respectively.  Characters who are notelled will also not recieve

2 'NUISANCE STAGES'~
#Immortal Punishment~
#END~
Stages of nuisances are the affects that the victim picks up while in
that stage.  As time progresses and the victim progresses through the
stages, they pick up new problems and the old ones gradually strengthen.
So for example if they are in stage 3 and progress to stage 4.  They
will feel more affects from stage 1,2 and 3 and pick up the affects from
stage 4. Power level is how hard they get hit with the affect. So if in stage
1 the affect was 2% of the time at power level 1 it may be 4% of the time
in power level 2.  And in stage 2 the affect in stage 1 may be 4% of the
time at power level 1 and 8% of the time at power level 2.
So with that being said here are the current stages and their affects:
Stage 1:  The Thirst Stage 
          This makes them become thirsty quicker.  The formula used is the
following: <current stage>*<power level> for how much more is added to your
following: <current stage>*<power level> for how much more is subtracted from
your thirst each time.  With 100 being not thirsty and 0 being dehydrated.
Stage 2:  The Hunger Stage
          The hunger stage works exactly as above except, the formula
subtracts 1 from the current stage becoming: (<current stage>-1)*<power level>
Stage 3:  The Mentalstate Stage
          In this stage each time your mentalstate worsens nuisance exagerates
the amount you worsen by. The formula used to compute how much more it 
adds or subtracts is: .4*(<current stage>-2)*<power level>.
Stage 4:  The Potion Stage
          In this stage you can not stomach as many potions as you normally
could without the nuisance flag.  Normally if your thirst or hunger is above
48 you can't quaf anymore.  Nuisance makes this a much lower number.
The formula used is: (48-(3*<current stage>)+<power level>)
So at power level 10, stage 10 you could only quaf 8 potions on an empty
stomach.
Stage 5:  The Wait Stage
          In this stage commands start taking longer to complete.  A
normal spell for example takes around 8-15 rounds of wait time.  With this
stage more wait time is added with the following formula:
(<current stage> -4 ) + <power level>    So at Stage 6 at power level 5,
each command would have an additionl 7 wait added to it.
Stage 6:  The Offensive Magic Stage
           In this stage you have a chance of targeting yourself with 
offensive spells instead of whatever target is specified.  The formula
for the percentage or the time you do it is the following:
(<current stage>-5)*8 + <power_level>*6  So at first stage 6 with a power
level of 5 you would have a 38% chance to target yourself with offensive
spells.
Stage 7:  The Defensive Magic Stage
          In this stage, if you are fighting someone you have a chance to
target them with any defensive spells you cast.  The formula used is the
following:  (<current stage>-6)*8 + <power_level>*6 
Continued in help 'NUISANCE STAGES2'
~

2 'NUISANCE STAGES2'~
#Immortal Punishment~
#END~
Stage 8:  The Speech Stage
          In this stage you have a chance to scramble your speech and
scramble other peoples speech (IE what you hear from them).  This works
on a percentage with the following formula:
(<current stage>-7)*10*<power level>  So at stage 9 with power level 2
speech is scrambled 40% of the time.
Stage 9:  The Movement Stage
            In this stage you start moving in random directions like a drunk
does.  This is worked out in a percentage as well. Which works of the 
following formula:  (<current stage>-8)*10*<power level>  So in stage 10
with a power level of 4 you would randomly choose an exit 80% of the time.
Stage 10:  The command Stage
           In this stage your commands start failing (Like mentalstate).
This is done on a percentage of the following:
(<current stage>-9)*10*<power level>  So at stage 10, power level 10 the
character becomes utterly useless, as commands will fail 100% of the time.
Soon there will be more options, when they come in the help files you should
see are:  'NUISANCE' 'NUISANCE STAGES' 'NUISANCE OPTIONS'

&GUnnuisance will remove the nuisance flag from a player.

&wThis only works on pc's.  The optional parameters are as follows:
  &cmaxtime <#> <minutes/days/hours>&w
         &wThe maxstage of nuisance. Default is 8 days.
  &ctime <#>&w:  The time in days that the nuisance flag will stay on the

         removed. If this option is not used it will default to a permenant
         penalty.
  &cpower <#>&w:  A number from 1 to 10, 10 being the worst for the player.

&WNote the words before the options are not optional and must be used.

&RExamples:  &cnuisance mortal maxtime 5 days time 7 power 5
&GThis would nuisance mortal for 7 days with the maximum stage being
reached in 5 days, at a power level of 5.  Also note you can leave options
out:  &cnuisance mortal maxtime 5 days power 5 &Gfor example would set the
maximum time to reach the final stage at a power level 5 and use the default
value for the time.  Also options can be rearranged n like:

0 OGRE~
#General Information Races~
#END~
----------------------------------------------BIO----------------------------------------------------
Ogres, creatures of nearly unsurpassed size and ferocity, the ogres and demi-ogres (Some ogres have 
been able to crossbreed with other "monstrous" races within Rafermand, though the ogres tend to 
share basically the same characteristics as eachother.) tend to be a reclusive people.  They populate 
harsh lands, being able to cultivate crops that only a race so crude could sustain themselves off of.  
It is said of the ogres that they can grow anything in even the harshest of climates due to an odd, 
innate sense of nature, but they have grown accostomed (maybe even to the point of enjoying) things 
that would be the bane of other civilizations.  Ogres are highly shamanistic, using primal, natural 
energies as a primitive form of invocation, which further drives their colonies out of general 
acceptance.  Ogres have few outside relations with the other races unless they are on a personal basis 
(such as ogre mercenaries, quite an asset), or when tools have broken and have to be 'replaced', at 
the cost of any nearby colonies of other races. (note, ogres have only the most brutish of capabilities
in their shamanistic powers...only a VERY RARE ogre will be able to tap into the natural forces for 
anything more than cultivating the crops the species lives off of.  One of the few tools created by the
ogres, specialized weaponry wrought from the twisted plants grown by their villages serve as deadly 
weaponry, sought after by those with strength and skill enough to use them properly.  Also, rare
clans of ogres are known to be less nomadic, though only one 'city' of such is rumoured to exist in the 
isles wrapped eternally in shadow...

2 OSET~
#Immortal Building BuildingObjs~
#END~
Syntax:  oset <object>    <field> <value>

If the copy of the object you are currently modifying has the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will also modify the index of that object, which all other
instances of the object are based on.  In the future, every copy of that obj
will reflect your modifications.
 
Also be aware that modifications to the object affect list (everything that
is listed after 'object values') will affect _every_ copy of that object in
the game, including old copies (even if they are not online).  Thus if you
change a prototype-flagged copy of a sword to +4 sanctify, every copy of that
vnum ever made will reflect that change.  If you add a 'magic' flag to that
sword, however, only copies made after the change will be affected.
 
If the copy of the object you are modifying does NOT have the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will affect only that copy.
 
OSET ON will lock you onto a particular object.  Once locked on, all commands
commands will imply 'oset <object>'.  Hitting enter while in OSET ON gives
you an ostat of the object you are working on.  To get out of OSET ON, simply
type the word DONE. Example:
 
        oset staff on
        long A long gnarled staff of burnished oak lies here.
        type weapon
        done

1 PARDON~
#General Roleplaying~

Syntax: pardon <player>

Pardon is used to pardon a player for any attacks, deaths, or acts of
thievery in the past.  It removes all such flags and returns your knowledge
of the player from negative (bad) to good.

0 PARRY~
#Combat Warrior BattleSkills~
#END~
Syntax:  parry [on/off]

Parry, like dodge, has been changed significantly from what it use to be in Smaug.
Parry sepends on a few factors now: dexterity of the one being attacked, strength
of the one attacking, and the one being attacked having parry turned on, and the
weapon you are using.  If you use identify or an identify scroll on a weapon you
should see the following

   Parry Mod 20  Parry Block Mod 2

Parry Mod is the actual value you use to parry with.  The higher the parry mod the
better the weapon is at parrying.  The Parry Block Mod is used to block a parry
with.  The value of 2 is very poor.  The following weapon sets are listed below
and their strength at the two catagories

   Swords - High Parry Rate, Average Block Rate.  Rapier is the best parrying sword
   Axes - Slightly Lower Parry Rate than Swords, Good Block Rate.
   Polearms - Average Parry and Block Rate
   Daggers - Best Parry Rate, Low Block Rate.  Main Gauche is the best parrying weapon
   Staves - Slightly better than Polearms in both areas
   Blunt - Low Parry Rate, Best Block Rate.

Custom weapons can have different rates depending on the type of the weapon and
what it is meant for, so always identify custom weapons.  Ore will not affect
the parry rate of a weapon, a copper dagger will be just as affective as a steel
one at parry.

Lastly, there is a 1 second lag (2 rounds) if you don't have the parry skill.  You
get a round nocked off at Novice and Expert.

0 PASSWORD~
#General Newbie~
#END~
Syntax:  password  <new password>   <new password>
 
PASSWORD changes your character's password.  You repeat the new password only.
If you do not get it correctly it will not work.  This should end the typo
locking you out of your character.
The PASSWORD command is protected against being snooped or logged; it is
impossible for any immortal to in any way see, find or retrieve it.  It
is the responsibility of the player to ensure that the password of the
character is kept secure.
 
Passwords can not contain certain characters, or spaces.  We also advise
that you use an alphanumeric password (one containing both numbers and
letters) as they are harder to guess.  We also recommend that you choose
a password that is greater than 6 characters in length.  A good rule of
thumb is if it is in the dictionary, it is probably not a good password.
 
NOTE:  if you decide to trade a character, you do so at your own risk.
Immortals are not responsible for ensuring fair trades.  You may seek an
immortal to oversee a trade, but it is not their  responsibility.
 
&YThe password policy is:  password equals ownership.&w

1 PASSWORD_ZMUD~
#General Newbie~
#END~
When you're using zMUD and want to change your password, remember to change
it in the zMUD character settings as well as on the mud.  The MUD's command
for this is:  password <new password> <new password>
In zMUD, click on 'File', then 'Another Character', or 'File', then 'Open'
to access the character settings - and change the password there.
If you have forgotten your character's password but can still log on with
the character, you can still find out what the password is.  Log on with
that character, click on 'View', then 'Preferences' and then click on
General Settings'.  Find the checkbox for 'Gag Password' and make sure the
box is not checked.  Click on 'Ok' to close the dialog box.
Type the command #say %pass [enter].  Your password will be shown on your
screen, but not sent to the mud.  Write it down, for future reference.

other player that is above this level, has 90 days before deletion.
All of these commands are set in the cset menu.  Also, the pfiles

1 'PICK LOCK'~
#Combat Thievery Thiefskills~
#END~
This skill enables you to pick open locked doors.
~

1 PIGGYBACK~
#General~
#END~
Syntax:  piggyback <target>

Piggyback allows you to jump on the back of a player and hitch a ride.  Whenever
the player giving the ride moves, the other one on his/her back will move along
too.  This works a lot like mount but there are a few key differences.  Mainly
you don't control the person you are riding, the person giving the ride is in
control.  Also, you cannot fight while riding someone.  If a fight starts with
either party involved, the riding status is immediately broken.  However, magic
can be casted while riding.  Any teleportation magic (astral, word of recall) will
affect both parties (including if the rider casts).  

Another thing with piggybacking is fighting is now allowed and any damage dealt
to either party will immediately brake the union.  If the rider wants to stop
the ride all that is needed is dismount.  In order to get the rider off the one
giving the ride, the toss command needs to be used (HELP TOSS).  Also, chance
cannot be changed by either party, only way to sit or sleep is to get rid of the
rider or to stop riding. 

Next, all moving costs are attributed to the person giving the ride.  The
weight of the rider is added to the total weight of the one giving the ride.
The weight is the actual weight of the rider (as shown by examine) along with
equipment weight (shown in score).  If that weight is too much, then piggyback
will fail.  If the weight is enough, the weight cost will affect movement
cost and a penality of double movement cost will be assigned no matter what.

On a final note, piggyback status is broken if either party leaves the game.
If a copyover happens the piggyback status is saved for that copyover only.
If a crash/reboot happens the status is reset.

NOTE:  Only immortals can stop this from happening by setting the noriders flag
in config.  Players cannot stop this from happening but it is considerable an
aggressive act to jump on someone's back when not invited, so be warned.

1 PINCER~

Type:  Manual Battle Skill
Syntax:  pincer enemy

A very powerful attack that requires the possession of two axes to

you can pince in a target between the two strikes.  Those who master
this skill will actually see a decrease in the time it requires to
swing two weapons at once plus an increase in total damage.  

If you happen to miss your pincer attack, you simply do a normal
attack at no loss to speed.

1 PKPOWER 'POWER LEVEL' 'PK LEVEL' POWERLEVEL PKLEVEL~
#Combat~
#END~
Power Level is the level you are assigned based on your Equipment Worth
and your Stat Worth. Since Rafermand is a levelless system numbers are
generated based on your stats. Stats are defined in this check as attribute
stats (strength, hp, mana) and also skills/spells learned.

Equipment worth is based on the strength of the equipment. Better equipment
gets assigned a higher worth. In addition, affects like hp additions, armor
additions, etc will be added to this value. Equipment worth is ONLY measured
by equipment that is worn and only checks 1 layer (so anything in a backpack
on your back is not counted).

This has an advantage of lowering your Power Level when you are killed because
you are now naked (which will make it harder to kill you without getting a twink
penalty unless it is kingdom related)

-1 PKRULES~
#Combat~
#General Laws~
#END~
There are a few rules to know about when it comes to player killing.
Those are.

1.  Camping will NOT BE TOLLERATED.  This is sitting in front of an
entrance with the intent to kill ALL who enter.  This will be one of
the few matters dealt with by immortals, and it will be dealt with
a harsh punishment.

2.  Banking will NOT BE TOLLERATED.  This applies to nonpkill areas
and it included making an area unrunable.  This includes such acts
as forcing keys not to pop, ruining mobprogs which are crutial to the
area, and charming mobs and leaving.  For more info type help banking.

3.  Weapons no longer disarm to the ground, but to the inventory of
everyone in any type of circumstance.  This rule might be changed
later if we feel it is needed.

4.  We do tollerate more bickering and "name calling" in FPK and APK
zones than we do in the normal parts of the game, but you should try
to avoid crossing the line into extreme harrassments, threatening in
an RL matter, sexual comments, and other talk/actions that are not
appropriate anywhere.  Most actions will get a warning based on the
intensity of the comment, after that, you will not be warned again.

5.  If you are being bullied by a player, it is up to the other players
to help you out.  Our system is setup not to reward such conduct, but
some players simply love to kill players who are weaker.  Try
talking to some of the outstanding players for help with the issue.

6.  Any items lossed or damaged during PKILL rather it is NPK, APK,
or FPK will not be reimbursed.  Neither will any "potential" items
on a FPK corpse that might of been lossed to a crash or other
incident.

7.  Finding loopholes without the EXPLICIT permission of immortals in
the SPK areas will not be allowed.  If you find one by accident, you
are to report it IMMEDIATELY or face punishment.

8.  There are hardcoded rules to prevent clan members from attacking
eachother, and this will not be changed.  Kingdom members cannot
attack eachother in the Kingdom Map/Kingdom cities, but can in the
normal areas and normal wilderness. There will be hardcoded rules to prevent
people from PKing a person while they are fighting, but until then PKing someone
while they are fighting a mob is HIGHLY illegal, so don't do it.

9.  You are not allowed to outcast a player from a clan simply to "setup"
that individual and kill him/her in a loot area.  This will not be tolerated
and will be punished.  If you are going to outcast a player, both players
must be in a safe area.

10. You cannot camp in the respawn room of player's kingdom and kill him/her.
This is called multikilling and is not allowed.  First there will be a warning, and
after that slayings, freezing, banning, whatever it takes.

recipient.  Be warned however, it has been told that poison has a strong
lessening effect on the lifetime of the weapon poisoned.

To poison a weapon you must have the weapon itself, the poisoning powder
and a full waterskin in your inventory.  The higher your intelligence, wisdom,

~

1 POLICY~
#Immortal~
#END~
This is the policy that is given to each immortal before they are allowed
to do anything on Rafermand.  You need to read this policy, and tell Xerves
you understand and accept its terms.  If you don't accept or understand, you
can talk to Xerves and a compromise might be had.

1.  Any building, coding, or editing done becomes respective property for
    both sides (meaning you can keep your code or area if you want it, I will
    not refuse giving it to you.  Also, it means Rafermand will keep a copy.)

2.  Any building, coding, or editing becomes physical property of Rafermand and
    cannot be removed or "extracted" from Rafermand without the permission
    of Xerves.

3.  Any building, coding, or editing done can be used in any way possible
    that is needed for Rafermand.  If you build it, I will use it.

4.  Once any changes are "finished" this policy takes place.

5.  Areas are considered finished once the area is properly connected to the
    world and the whole area is unfolded (made non-prototype)

6.  Code is finished once it is put into the Rafermand source code.

7.  Any other change will be "finished" once it is actually performed.
    (Say you are making a spell online, any thing you do will be considered
    "finished")
 
8.  Any exceptions to this policy might be considered if asked, but in
    a later dispute, the policy will be considered in full.

Once you understand and accept this policy, you will be placed in the proper
level that you are suppose to be in.

1 PORTALS~
#Magic~
#END~
In Rafermand (Code FeAr v1.0) the introduction of new portal systems was
put into place.  Portal systems are actual portal areas located in the
city you belong to and the portals out in the Wilderness.

In order to find these portals, you first must start out by going to the
portal in your city and using the command 'huntportals' to start to hunt
portals or end hunting portals.  Once you are hunting portals, you cannot
use or be targeted by spells that would allow you to move around like
astral or summoned by summon.  You will have to locate the portals in
the map.  To make it a little more fun, the portals will now show up till
you are close to them, but the portals are close to major areas in the map
so just search around to find them.  (Please note, you will not find portals
you haven't found already or be able to mark new ones if you are not hunting
portals.)

Once you find a portal, you just goto the square it is on and use the command
'markportal' to add it to your list.  Once you have found the portal, you can
use 'listportals' to get a list of all the portals you have found.  Also, once
you have marked the portal, it will show up on the map in normal view so you
can go to it easier and use it.

Once you have decided to stop hunting new portals, you can go back and use the
'huntportals' command again to stop hunting the portals so you can use them to
portal, astral, etc.  Once you get to a portal you want to use, you can use the
command 'listportals free' to get a list of portals that are free to use the
portal spell on (meaning they don't have a portal in them already).  Also, make
sure there isn't a portal object at the portal you are at.  If you want to use
astral, helical, etc you can use it without worring if a portal is created there
or not.

Once you decide to use a spell to go to a portal, to goto that portal, all you do
is use the number next to it in listportals.  So if you want to go to [2] on the
list you would use this syntax

c 'astral' 2   or   c 'portal' 2

That is about all there is for portals.  You will have to go to the main portal in
the city to hunt for new ones, and go out and mark them for use later.  You should
look around areas for portals and it will make it easier to get to them without
walking a lot in the map.
~

1 POSITIONS~
#General Information Players~
#Combat~
#END~
At current time, there are 15 "positions" in the game. Positions
are in a special order.  If position b is below position a on the
list, that indicates that while in position b, you have more 
physical or mental energy to spend on a task, be it a command,
a spell, or a skill.
 
For example, while standing, you have a greater ability to do things
than while sitting.  While fighting evasively, you have more options
than while fighting aggressively.
 
The ordered list is as follows, left to right, top to bottom:
0 - Dead                            1 - Mortally Wounded        
2 - Incapacitated                   3 - Stunned       
4 - Sleeping                        5 - Fighting (Berserk)
6 - Resting                         7 - Fighting (Aggressive)   
8 - Sitting                         9 - Fighting (Std)
10- Fighting (Defensive)            11- Fighting (Evasive)

A rather useful spells to those who need a bit of healing and want to harm their

Syntax: cast 'power heal' <target>

As the name suggests, the caster casts a very powerful healing spell on the
target.  The spell will restore a huge amount of health, and will drain the
caster of a large amount of mana.  The time to recover from this spell is one
of the longest, so be prepared for that.
~

1 'POWER RANKING' POWER RANKING~
#General~
#END~
Power Ranking is a point value based on the quality of pkills you are making
along with your Power Level. In short, the better the person you attack, the
more Power Ranking points you will earn. The amount of points you gain is based
on the Power Ranking of the person you killed and the Power Level difference
between the two combatants. Based on these numbers you can take 0 Power Ranking
points from the other player or half of the Power Ranking points if you get a high
quality kill.

Power Ranking points are generated by your Power Level and additional points can be
earned by killing others. In general you will win this catagory by killing other people
and taking their points, but it is possible to win this catagory by stat building alone.

Lastly, the minimum Power Ranking is 1 point. You start the game with 20 and can go as
low as 1. When you reach 1 point you cannot give any points to anyone else. The winner
of a fight will get 1 point from a fight UNLESS the victim only has 1 Power Ranking Point.

for immortals to place any of the 6 ideas.  Once a project is first published it
is available for immortal view only and then can be changed from Private to
any kind of status that the public can view.  Also, notes can be posted from anyone
to discuss the subject or post additional content on the subject.  Lastly, anything
that is done is marked as Done and will only be viewable using the done or all argument
in project list.

Note:  Once a project is posted if you are a player you cannot modify it.  If you
need to add additional information add logs or ask to have it deleted.  You will
be able to view your private postings along with the immortals, but other players
will not be able to view it till it is turned public.

LASTLY:  Improvement is an idea on an already implemented item.  Idea is a new
item not yet implemented.  Building and Coding is for immortal posted projects
and you should not post to it.  The post a project it would work like this

will be set back to the game default.

The fprompt sets your fighting prompt.  This is the prompt that is displayed
to you while you are fighting.  It follows the same format as the normal
prompt does.
Your prompt can be any string of characters that you wish. You can also embed
special characters and tokens into the string that you set. These special
characters are linked with specific groups of tokens. These tokens will add
specific sets of information to your prompt.
 
The first special character is:  %
Tokens for % are:

Boss (0 - Reg, 1 - Captain, 2 - Boss) Difficulty (1-13) Sex(0-2)

Qmob is used to add mobs to the quest system.  To quickly allow the addition
of new mobs, most of the stats are generated by the difficulty of the quest so
only some basics are nedded.  It, however, does allow for a lot of variety because
of the flags you can set on a mob to add anyting from extra hp to defense flags.

Only thing to really know about is the boss values.  0 is for a regular mob.  This
is the "easiest" of all mobs in the quests.  1 is for the captain mobs.  The captain
mob ranges from 1-5 mobs in the area.  These mobs always drop eq if they are humanoid
and have a good chance of loading quest eq.  The boss mob also loads eq and has the
highest chance to load quest eq.  There is only 1 boss mob per quest.

There are two flags arguments.  flags replaces all flags on the qmob and aflags toggles
any flags provided (so it will remove a flag if it exists)

NOTE:  You can set more than one flag at at time.  You set them via the number that
is available in (HELP QMOBFLAGS)

Qobj is used to add objects that will only be used by quests.  All quest objects used
by this system use the vnum 66 for the base object (so don't delete it).  Most of
the quest objects need to be set manually because there is no "automatic" adjustions
for objects like there is with mobs.  

Like qmob, boss values are used.  0 is for a regular mob, 1 is for a captain (up to
5 per quest) and 2 is used for boss (up to 1 per quest).  

NOTE:  You can set more than one flag at at time.  You set them via the number that
is available in (HELP QOBJFLAGS)

Lastly, there are two arguments for flags: flags and aflags.  flags will simply replace
all flags on the object where aflags will toggle the flags on the object (adding the flag
if the flag does not exist or remove the flag if it exists)

Everyone's favorite destruction spell, quantum spike has stood the test of time
in reaking havok and causing massive amounts of pain.  The first true hyper-powerful
spell for the arcane, quantum spike was the first and still in some eyes the strongest
of the Tier 4 spells.  It causes a huge hole in space, which then shakes and tears away
at the targets flesh causing massive amounts of damage and leaving them a little out
of whack if you know what I mean.

Welcome to the quest system.  The Rafermand quest system is a fully automated,
random area/mob/object generation system.  By selecting from the different
variables above a quest will be loaded and you can go enjoy the killing or
being killed.  The first command available is used to manually set the
variables for a quest.  Difficulty ranges from 1-13.  Typically, a single
quest will not go over a difficulty of 10 (11-13 is reserved for 3-6 parties
of very experienced players).  Many of the mobs in the 11-13 are equivalant
of Tier 1 mobs and instead of having them for bosses they are wandering around
as regular mobs.  However, as with the risk the rewards from these mobs are of
course the best.  Difficulty 13 offers some of the best equipment in the game.

Missions are different missions you need to complete to get qps.  Besides the
fun of getting spoints (HELP SPOINTS) from killing tons of mobs, you will
also get QPS for completing the mission in a certain amount of time.  QPS can
be spent on getting your corpse out of a quest if you don't want to wait for
it to end (HELP MORGUE) or better it can be spend on equipment only available
through spending QPS.  As of this writing the only mission available is slaughter.
Slaughter is a mission where you have to slaughter most of the mobs loaded.

Size is the actual size of the dungeon.  1 is the smallest dungeon and consists
of 50 rooms.  6 is the largest consisting of 300 rooms.  It is a good idea to
pick something that matches how much time you have to spend on the quest and
the amount of QPS you are hoping to get (more on that later)

Mob Count is simply the amount of mobs in the dungeon.  1 is the lowest rate (below
1 per room) and 6 is around 3 per room.  This might not sound like a lot, but
the mobs wander and you can see 3-4 times that in one room.

(CONTINUE ON WITH QUEST2)
(Quest Obj is covered in QUEST4)
~

1 QUEST2~
#General~
#END~
The second command is used if you want a quest generated for you based on your
sworth (HELP SWORTH).  This can give you an idea on a difficulty to select if
you do not know what to try.  The easiest settings pick a difficulty rating
you should be easily capable of handling and it loads a small zone along with
a small amount of mobs.  The higher settings load a much more difficulty zone
but it keeps the amount of mobs and rooms to that of a middle-difficulty quest.

Next is the status command.  This shows you the status of the quest that you
are in and shows you the QPS/Wins/Losses you have accumulated.  A quest goes
through 3 stages.  The first is the travel time.  You have 20 minutes before
the quest will actually begin.  Once any member of your party (more on that)
enters the quest officially begins.  Once the quest is won or lost you have
25 minutes to hunt down the boss or get out.  After 25 minutes any corpses
in the quest will be moved to the morgue and the players will be moved to the
entrance of the quest (along with your mount).  

Lastly, the fail command fails a quest rather you have actually started it or
not.  Only the leader of the quest can fail it, so keep that in mind when you
choose the person to actually get the quest.

As mentioned before, you can bring a group into the quest.  You have to have
the group before hand because the quest data is stored on the players that
begin the quest.  You will not be able to bring outside help into your quest so
it is important to get them involve before you go in not after.  Adding group
members does increase the difficulty of a dungeon, but it also increases the
yield of the dungeon along with the QPS.  Also, you cannot start a quest with
6 and then intend to get all the QPS.  QPS are assigned before the quest and
reguardless of who is left, you get that cut of the QPS.  Lastly, you can only
have a party that is close in sworth.  This means the highest member cannot
have 2 times more sworth than the lowest member.  You will be told this before
starting a quest.

NOTE:  If all your party has 150k or more sworth, the Sworth rule does not apply.

(CONTINE ON with QUEST3)
~

1 QUEST3~
#General~
#END~
As mentioned QPS are assigned before a quest.  QPS are generated based on the
difficulty of the quest, the number of rooms in it, the number of mobs, and
the number of players involved.  Picking the smallest amount of mobs and rooms
will get you a greatly reduced number of QPS than compared to picking something
in the middle.  QPS are only assigned on wins and cannot be transfered.  QPS
can only be won if you are present in the quest zone when the win happens.  If
you go LD or you are dead when they finish you will get not QPS, so keep this
in mind, you need your whole party there or they miss out.  (NOTE:  You are
considered still logged in if you are LD.  If you are LD in the actual quest zone
you will get the points)

The quest zones themselves only stay in memory as long as there is no copyover,
reboot, or crash.  There will be no reimbursement on anything eaten by this unless
it is a corpse (which should be moved to limbo and retreivable by an imm).

Lastly, there are some mob information you should know.  First, a boss mob will
only spawn in a 100 room or better quest (this is a size of 2 or better).  The
captain mobs only spawn 1 per 50 rooms (So only a captain spawns in a size 1).  Both
of these mobs are more difficult than the normal mobs but they drop more ore
equipment/gold and also have a better chance of dropping quest equipment.  Next,
there is a "common" mob that loads close to half the time in each quest.  Lastly,
there is a limit on how much gold/ore equipment is loaded in the zone.  Just because
your common mob is a PC-race mob does not you will walk out with a TON of ore.

Quest obj allows you to purchase quest objects with your QPS.  Items

you might be able to rack up quest points to purchase things outside of
your scope of difficulty.  Below is a brief bit of help on each option.

obj qps - Lists quest objs in the range of qps you provide.
obj type - Lists quest objs according to type (HELP QUESTTYPES)
obj diff - Lists quest objs according to difficulty (1-13)
obj buy - Purchases the number listed in any of the above options.

~

2 QUEST5~
#General~
#END~
quest view [quest num]
quest static <difficulty> <vnums> <mob count> <area name> <filename> <reset time>

All commands listed here are imm only.  Quest view allows you to view what quests
are currently running and who is involved.  You can type the command without the
quest view option to get a short list of all quests.  Providing the number will
give a detailed view of the quest.

Quest static creates a static area that can be linked into the game.  This will
create a self-sustained area with all mobs/objects saved in the area and resets
will be generated for the area.  This area will save all equipment including
stuff created on the ground and in inventories.  All forge equipment will be
copied to the area and will behave like normal forge equipment.  Once the area
is done, there will be no changes to the area (hence the static option).

Once you have decided the static area is perfect for you, you can use the command 
foldqarea (HELP FOLDQAREA) to fold the area and install it into the game. If you choose 
not to use the area, you can use the command unloadqarea (HELP UNLOADQAREA) to take the 
area out and try again. Once unloadqarea is used, you can use the exact filename and area 
name that you used before. The options for static areas are difficulty (1-13), vnums 
(50-2000), mob count(20 to 500), area name (put in quotes for more than 1 word), 
filename, and then reset time (1 to 10080). Note: Mob count is a percentage. 20 percent 
of a 100 vnum area = 20 mobs (plus bosses/captains). 

Note:  Vnums for static areas are 200,000 - 299,999.  Vnums for an area are taken
after the highest vnum in this range.  So if there is a massive gap between the
areas you will lose the amount of static areas you can have.  It is best to do 1
static area at at time.  Do it offline, keep loading them till you find the 1
you want, foldqarea then move on.

1 QUICKCOMBO~
#General~
#END~
Syntax:  quickcombo right/left strike1 strike2 strike3 strike4 strike5 victim
Note: strike3-5 is available if you have expert/elite/flawless in quickcombo.

When it comes to dealing out pure damage in the Spiritual sphere, look no further.  
Those who completely master this skill are able to string together 5 attacks at
once and execute them in a rather quick fashion.  You start out with the ability
to string only 2 attacks together, but as your mastery increases, you gain the
next 3 attacks.

Only things of note is that you need to provide a right or left target even if
you are not using the hand/leg strikes and each strike has to be to a different
limb (so if you are using all 5 they need to be head/neck/body/leg/arm).  A
good reason to get up to Tier 4 in your strikes and just watch the damage pile
up.

1 QUIT QUI~
#General Information Players~
#END~
Syntax: QUIT
 
QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the game
you will be back in the same room, unless that room has a prog that moves
you upon re-entry.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just
one command.  Nevertheless, it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you
get into the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other
mud that doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.
 
There is no RENT here.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.

-1 RAFERMAND~
#General~
#END~
Rafermand is the name of the World in which we play in.  It is also the name of
the Central Continent in Rafermand (confused yet).  Rafermand was orginally thought
up by Xerves and created in August of 1998 in the form of an RoT mud.  This lasted
about 2 or 3 months until November of 1998 in which it was setup as a Smaug mud (hence
the birthdate of Rafermand in November).  Then around February or so, we moved to the
stormbringer server where we have been since.  The code featured then can be explained
best as pre Fear 1.0.  I was just a beginning coder and was trying to get my feet wet.
During this time I published what is probably one of my two most popular snippets, the
Remort snippet, and was one of the few Smaug muds with such a system.  I also put out
the furniture snippet out at this time, which might be the most popular, I am not sure.

Later on, the release of Fear 1.0 came out, this was the time of the new Wilderness.  Afer
working with an older Wilderness with 2000 rooms, we went to the snippet released by
Samson.  After a lot of changes to the appearance and a few bug fixes (not sure if I caused
em or not) it was ready to go.  Took some time to clean it up to fix some bugs, but eventually
it was up and running.  This was the time of the skill system changes, Wilderness changes,
and the beginning of two companies, the Chocobos (and their past) and the Highwaymen.

Next came Fear 1.1 which added more changed (more skill changes) and some other big changes.
The game play was still fairly similar, but we are building up to 2.0

Then we arrive on Beta 2.0.  2.0 is a huge step away from what 1.x was and a big change on
the playing system that a few didn't like (and a pwipe).  Most of the default Smaug systems
were rewritten and new systems like forge, battle, no level/classes, balanced skill system,
and other things were introduced.  2.0 is oriented toward kingdom related warfare and peaceful
actions, just depending on what the players wanted.

Would like to think all those who have contributed over the past 3 years and hopefully to the
next 3...

2 RANK~
#Immortal System~
#END~
Rank is a special command that allows the player to change their default
rank. The syntax is: rank blah.

Please do not abuse this command. Certain things cannot be said or used as
a rank. These are but not limited to:

-Profanity
-Abusive phrases such as "Bob is lame."
-Ethnic, racial, and sexual slurs
-Anything that pertains to saying a character is better than another. An example
  would be: Bob is a better cleric than Joe

 Note: Immortals have the final say as to what is not appropriate for a rank
and maybe remove the rank command if they see fit.

REBOOT shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of sixty seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

SHUTDOWN shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.

WIZLOCK is a toggle command.  When the server is WIZLOCKed, players
may not log in.  Players who lose their links, however, may reconnect.

If nosave is specified for reboot or shutdown, it will not automatically
save all of the players.

1 'REIMB' 'REIMBURSEMENT'~
#General Laws~
#END~
The following are causes we will NOT reimburse for:
-- Loss of corpse due to corpse decay.  See "help corpse" for details.
-- Loss of corpse due to lag.
-- Loss of corpse due to problems with your system or the net.
-- Individual items lost due not saving your character regularly.
-- Individual items lost because they were zapped or dropped on the ground.
-- Containers lost because they were left on ground or destroyed by a mob.
-- Weapon loss due to disarm before crash, reboot, or from a mob taking it.
-- Items lost due to hitting a death trap
-- Items lost due to scrapping by mobs or other players
-- Items lost due transferring equipment from one character to another.
-- Items lost due to not saving after looting your corpse and a crash occurs.
 
Corpses are now saved across crashes and reboots, eliminating the need
for most reimbursements due to corpse loss.  The ONLY cause for reimbursement
is when a corpse reappears in the game empty after a crash or reboot.

To apply for a reimbursement post a note on the ToImmortal Board explaining the
circumstances of the loss and the five items you had prior to loss that you
would like reimbursed.  We will not reimburse certain items, such as gold,
potions, glory, clan items, or more than one weapon.  We will only consider
reimbursement requests made within one hour of a reboot or crash.  Only a
level 61 or higher may do a reimbursement, but any level Immortal has the right
to deny one. We will attempt to be fair and deal with the request as expeditiously
as possible. Do not pester or spam an Immortal about a reimbursement. It is a
privilege, not a right. If an Immortal denies a reimbursement do not argue with
them, for their judgement is final, unless a Staff Immortal or higher decides
otherwise.

We can specify names that we want to reserve because they belong to
former imms (like Narn and Dominus). We can specify names that are
often tried and are a bit of a pain (like Killer or Satan or Seth).
 
We can specify parts of names by preceding the string with an "*">
e.g.  reserve *goof
This will prevent any name with the substring "goof" ... like ...
"goofface", "biggoof" or "biggoofface".
All deity names should be reserved.

  The order that resets are in is VERY important.  You cannot equip
  a mobile with an object before putting the mobile into a room first.
  Likewise, you cannot put an object into a container until the container is
  put into a room first.

This command is used to display, edit, delete, add and insert resets for
your area.

NOTE: You need to specify the 1 in mob for it to pick up the coords 
correctly. This works this way because it use to be the limit value. You 
can also specify only the 2 vnums for the mob to reset it into a room

1 RESETKEEPER~
#Kingdoms Management~
#END~
Syntax: resetkeeper

A simple command that resets the items into your shopkeeper and saves it all
into the area.  Mostly used after you do a goldtake/goldgive/keeperset on
the mob.  Please refrain from abusing this command, or you might lose your
right to have a shopkeeper.

NOTE:  Need to be in the room with your shopkeeper

3 RESETS~
#Immortal Building Resets~
#END~
When it comes to making sure everything works ok, there are a few things
to consider when planning resets.  Here are a few things you should know
about resets, and changes to the reset system in FeAr Code.

1.  Mobs now reset based on a serial number given to them when they are loaded
    into the world.  You do not set this serial in anyway, so just don't worry about
    it.
2.  Because of the serial resets, mobs load as they are added.  You cannot expect to put
    in one reset for a mob and have a count of 4 of them in the old system.  If one mobile is
    added into the reset list, one is added.
3.  Never use instazone, even if it is available.
4.  instaroom works very well for adding resets in a room.  It will correctly pick up any reset
    and do proper nesting of objects in objects, etc.
5.  If you want to do an instazone, it is recommended that you do a rat <begin vnum> <end vnum>
    instaroom.  This will reset all the rooms in an area.
6.  You can use the reset command to manually add resets, edit resets, shift resets, or delete them
7.  If you do manual resets, remember that you need to have any objects on a mob or in an item to follow
    the reset for that mobile or object.
8.  reset edit is good for changing a room of a mobile if you need to spread them out.  This will keep
    any equiped items on the mobile properly reset too. 
9.  Time based resets have a few tricky rules, might check out (HELP TIMERESETS) for more info

Syntax:  rest
Syntax:  sleep
Syntax:  stand
Syntax:  wake
 
These commands change your position.
 
When you REST or SLEEP, you regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement
points at a much faster rate.  However, you are more vulnerable to attack,
and if you SLEEP you won't hear many things happen.
 
Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can also WAKE
other sleeping characters.

1 RESTORE~
#Immortal ImmPlayers~

Syntax: restore <character>
        restore all

RESTORE restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to the
target character.  RESTORE ALL does this for all mortals except player
killers and any who happen to be in the arena.
 
A note on RESTORE ALL: This is a gift from the gods, and it is never 
planned in advance or done on request.  The best way to ensure that a
restore all will NOT be done is to ask for one.

1 RESTORELIMB RESTORELIMBS~
#Combat~
#END~
If you lose a limb you will find that you need to have it restored.  
To get back your limbs you can either die or goto a healer and get it
restored.  There is a healer in Rolen camp that you can use.  The cost 
is associated with your max hp.  The more hp you have, the more it will 
cost to restore a limb.

Note:  You can die to get all your limbs restored, but they are all dropped to
1 point of health
~

2 RESTORETIME~
#Immortal ImmPlayers~

1 RESURRECTION 'GREATER RESURRECTION' REZ REVIVE~
#General~
#END~
Syntax:  c 'resurrection' corpse
Syntax:  c 'greater resurrection' corpse
Syntax:  resurrection [yes]

A very powerful spell used to resurrect the dead corpse of an ally.  You must
be physically in the room with the corpse of the target and the target must
be online (including not writing notes, etc).  Once the spell is casted on
the corpse the target will receive a message along with the rez percent.  The
percent is the amount of lost con is returned along with the percentage of
hp/mana/move that is restored upon accepting.

The actual command used to accept a rez is resurrection.  Just typing the command
without any arguments shows you the percent you have now.  Typing the yes argument
will accept the rez.

While this is a great spell, there are a few things to be aware of

1.  resurrection has a time limit, which is roughtly 1-3 hours depending on
    the strength of the spell.  After the time limit you cannot rez a corpse.
2.  resurrection will not resurrection an equipment less corpse due to the
    fact it's timer gets reset down to about 5 minutes.  If you catch it just
    as the target dies you might be able to get it of though....
3.  You can only resurrect a corpse once.  Once this is done the corpse is
    marked as resurrected and the target's lost con value is reset so unless
    the target dies another resurrection cannot occur.  So make sure you
    are accepting a rez for the right corpse.
4.  If you died 40 times and lost 3 con points, you can only recover a max
    of 1 con point.
5.  There is a rez affect that lasts 1 minute that lowers your hp/mana regen
    rate and decreases your armor and tohit value.
6.  A rez is removed if the player logs off.  The con loss is however kept over
    no matter if a corpse is lost or not.

#General~
#END~
Syntax:  c 'revitalize limb' <target>
Syntax:  c 'restore limb' <target>

Revitalize, being the weaker spell of this spell line, is only capable of healing
damage done to limbs.  Restore limb will actually restore a broken limb to a very
weaken state.  Broken limbs are only capable of being fixed through a healer, this
spell, or death.  Restoring health to limbs can be achieved through revitalize or
just time.
~

1 'REVITALIZE SPIRIT'~
#General~
#END~
Syntax:  c 'revitalize spirit' <target>

A very useful spell that restores the mentalstate of the target back to 0.  It might
require a handful of castings if the target's mentalstate is horribly screwed up.
Mentalstate is typically screwed up from not eating/drinking or from poison.
~

3 REWARD~
#General~
#END~
Syntax:  reward <target> <give/take> <points>

The reward command is used to give/take away reward points.  Reward points
can be given out for quests or typically they are handed out for bug fixes/
typo fixes/inviting or retaining newbies.  If you are looking for the reward
listing and points, simply see (HELP REWARDS).

As for reward command, it can be used to give points (increasing the points
and the total points) or take away points (decreasing points, not changing the
total points).  If you wish to modify either value mset can be used to manually
adjust reward points.  

Lastly, you don't have to be in the same room as the target to use this command
but the target has to be online.
~

1 REWARDS~
#General~
#END~
The reward system was introduced in 2.1.  It is really a byproduct of
the old system used to assign glory to be used for restringing and
other favors.  This is pretty much the same but is used mostly to
reward reporting of bugs/typos.  It is also used to reward helping with
newbies.  The following below are the rules reguarding reward points.

Minor Bug     - 2 Reward Points
Moderate Bug  - 5 Reward Points
Major Bug     - 20 Reward Points
Typo          - 1 Reward Point (a typo is counted as 1 room, 1 item, etc.  If there
                are 3 typos in one room it is counted as 1 typo)
Player Invite - 20 Reward Points (must play for 21 days)
Player Help   - 10 Reward Points (must be posted by newbie, max of 3 named people.  Same
                21 day rule here too)

Reward points are transferable to any player on your account but are not
transferable to another player at any time for any reason.  Reward points
are exactly as stated, rewards.  You are in no way to argue if it is a minor
or moederate bug, you simply take the points you are assigned.  Any points
given out by any staff besides Xerves needs to be noted on the Immortal gboard
for my approval.  

Reward points are given in "first reported" fashion.  Bugs need to be reported to the
project board in order for points to be rewarded.  Telling me about it simply will not
count as "first reported".  There will be no argueing about "Player X stole my report" the
first one I see is the first to get the points, so you can take it out in a Fullloot zone
if you want to resolve your issues.  Typos are to be reported to either as a project if
you are collecting a mass of them or you can use the typo command.  I will put a limit on
points rewarded for typos and since I don't do typos often, don't think that you can find
1000 typos and get 1000 points.

Lastly, reward points can be given out for quests or any other kind of assistance
that an immortal needs (such as building, etc).  This can be any offline/online
work that is needed by an immortal.  

See (HELP REWARDS2) for the actual rewards available (will be updated with demands from
players and newly thought rewards)
~

rooms including and after the argument, and when used with two arguments, 
it will list all rooms including and between the two. 
~

1 ROAR~
#General~
#END~
Type:  Manual Combat Skill
Syntax:  roar

It might not be proper time management to fight those small beasties again
that take a few hits in the head and die.  Instead, you can let out a mighty
roar and scare them away.  Roar is effective against small creatures and
will make them stop persueing you, but is ineffective against larger, more
scary fiends.   Lastly, it will work against a whole group in attempt to
scare them off.
~

1 ROLL~
#General~
#END~
Syntax:  roll <low num> <hi num>

Rolls a number in the range provided.  Typical use is roll 1 100
to roll a 100 side dice.  The primary use is to help fairly decide
who should win the loot (type laws loot for examples).  It can also
be used to gamble with and other fun things.
~

1 ROOF~
#Kingdoms Creation~
#END~
Syntax: roof build
Syntax: roof update
Syntax: roof destroy

Roof is used to create a roof around your building so the outside cannot
see in and the inside cannot see out.  This feature is new in 2.1 and offers
a lot of interesting uses.  In the new system, your building options are cut
down quite a bit from the old system, but the ability to create closed off
rooms is something altogether new and very interesting.  Once a roof is placed
on a room, a door can control rather you can see inside/outside of the room.
If the door is closed, you cannot see inside and the people inside cannot see
the outside world.  This can be very useful if you want to keep people out
of your business while you are inside of your town.  In order to use this
command, you first need to understand the whole idea on how to create a room.

2 sectortypes are involved in this creation, inside and wall.  In order to use
either one, you need to have first did a makeroom (help MAKEROOM).  Once the
rooms you want to use are in place, you can then create a roof over the rooms.
In order to do this, all the inside sectors have to have either an inside
sector in all directions or a wall.  If any other sector is discovered, the
area is not "closed off" so a roof cannot be built.  Here are two examples of
a closed off area and one that is not.

IIIII
I%%%D
IIIII

In the above example, I is the wall, % is the inside sector, and D is the door.
As you can see, there is no gap in the example.  Now here is an example that
will not work
IIIIII
I%%%%%D
IIIIIII

As you notice, ne of the last % there is an open space.  A roof will not be built
in this example.

Lastly, you can only have 100 doors per town, so choose them wisely.

Syntax:  rub <rune> <portal location>

Rub is the command used to rub a rune.  As of now, you can only use the
rune to "portal" to a marked portal.  This can either be a number on your
list or "home" or "newbie".  For more info, see the below helpfiles.

1 RUNE RUNES~
#Wilderness~
#END~
A Rune is a magical enhanced item that can be rubbed to release the magical
powers from the center of the object.  There are many different kind of
runes in the world, but the most popular and abundant of those are the
ones that can be used to "portal" back and forth between portals.

This works by using the rub command on the rune and then telling it which portal
to go to.  Rather that be one marked on your list or "home" or "newbie".

It pretty much works like the portal system, but in order to use the rune
you have to be at a portal (unlike astral walk).  Also, after so many rubs the
rune will eventually destroy itself, so stock as many as you need.

Runes can be found at the Magical shop in Rafermand city, or out in the world.

1 'RWUNDI STYLE'~
#General~
#END~
Type:  Automatic Battle Skill

An advanced style tought to only those who have learned the ones before
Rwundi.  Rwundi actually reduces the amount of damage taken.  Like
stone skin, it can only reduce the damage to 1 (never below 1 for a hit).
A few hp might not seem like a lot, but if you are taking a bunch of hits,
this little thing could save your life.
~

1 'RWUNDO STYLE'~
#General~
#END~
Type:  Automatic Battle Skill

Just the opposite of Krundo, Rwundo Style increases the ability for you
to land a hit against your opponent.  Increasing your chances to land
a blow natually will increase the damage you yield to an opponent.  Together
these styles start to form the Perfect Warrior.
~

1 'SACRED BLAST'~
#Magic Cleric Hindering~
#END~
Channeling all the power that the cleric has to heal, sacred blast turns this power
around and forces it to cause pain on the target.  While it is not quite the power of
such spells as quantum spike and heavenly blast, sacred blast does hold a very strong
deterant toward any ememy who thinks he stands a chance against the cleric.

1 SACRIFICE~
#General Objects~
#END~
Syntax:  sacrifice <object>
 
Sacrifice offers an object to the gods, or to your Order or Clan's deity.

SAVE saves your character, your inventory, and any mounts you may have.  You
must be authorized and in the game before you can save.  The system automatically
saves your character in a period around 5 minutes, but it is important to do
manually saves when you can just in case of a crash or some other bad event.
 
Type SAVE immediately after recovering your corpse, getting new items, making 
purchases or repairs, etc.
 
Some objects (such as keys) may not be saved.  Every character is auto-saved 
at reboot or a copyover.

4 SCATTER~
#Immortal Punishment~
#END~
Scatter is the quintessential 'go away' command.  When used, it will send
its target to a random location in the world (most likely the wilderness).
The target is then susceptible to any forces at that location, be they
natural (drowning) or aggressive mobiles.  Caution should be used when
using this command, wouldn't want to be flinging mortals helplessly about
the world, now would we?  Well not most of us anyway.

1 SCHEDULE~
#General~
#END~
Syntax: schedule view <town>
Syntax: schedule add <town> <start period> <end period> <resource> [reoccur]
Syntax: schedule remove <town> <number>

Schedule is used to place workers out during a certain period of the year.  It
will automate the training and the extraction of these workers for you.  I will
repeat this only once though, the system is not foolproof and should in no way
be ran over a long period of time unmanaged.  You never know when someone sneaks
up and kills your worker and then you are out a worker plus whatever the worker
was working on.  The system will not respawn any workers for you if they die.  With
that....

Schedule can be used by the mayor of a town to schedule workers for that town
or can be used by King/number1/number2 to manage any town.  You use view to check out
the schedule for that town, add to add something, and remove to well remove.  The only
really tricky thing is the period value.  Workers now work on a 7.5 GD (4.5 RL Hour)
system, so you can place them on this schedule in a period on it.  There are 48 periods
(48 * 7.5 = 360 = 1 GY).  Anyway, below is a chart with the time of the periods to make
it easier on you.

Start Date            End Date         Period

0 SCRIBE BREW~
#Skills~
#END~
&YSyntax&W: brew <spell name>
&YSyntax&W: scribe <spell name>

A powerful skill for those of magic blessing.  Must be holding a blank 
scroll or empty flask.  May transform them into spelled scrolls or potions 
via the scribe and brew commands.

It takes significantly more mana to bind a spell to a potion or scroll
than to simply cast it.
 
In order to brew a potion you need a fire unless you are a master in the
skill.

NEW:  There has been some major modifcations to brew and scribe.  There are
now 3 different flasks and scrolls available.  You can only brew/scribe a
Tier 2 spell if you are an expert in brew/scribe and a Tier 3 spell requires
a master in brew/scribe (sorry no Tier 4 spells will be brewable/scribeable).

In addition you now must have a master status in the spell you which to brew
or scribe.

Used to send email from the user account running the game.  If you have
acount email enabled this will work, if not you will not be able to use
this command.  It is a good idea to reserve this for those you trust not
to send out junk email.  

Note:  I tried to be secure about this command, it does not access the
shell directly but the program instead.  I cannot promise that it is
100 percent secure and not vulnerable to some kind of overflow attack
so grant this to users at your own risk.

3 SETBOOT~
#Immortal System Reboot~
#END~
Syntax: setboot time <hour> <minute>
 	setboot manual <0|1>

The setboot command is useful for planning a reboot, (to save you from 
the trouble of all those echos :) ) and for the daily boot.  The manual
bit is used by the mud to determine whether the boot time was set by 
hand.  When the mud starts up, the boot time is set to 0600hrs (6am)
and the manual bit to 0.  If 'setboot time' is used, the mud sets the
manual bit to 1.  When it comes time to do the reboot, the mud checks
how long it has been running.  If it has been running less than 18 
hours and the reboot time has not been set manually, the reboot does
not take place (nor do the automatic warning echoes).

Echoes: when a scheduled reboot is coming up, the mud will send out
echoes to that effect.  The echoes start 30 minutes before the reboot
and are repeated at t minus 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 minute(s).

This command allows you to set the options on a slay type.

<Type> is the command argument for the SLAY command, and identifies which
slay you will be editing.

Field can be one of the following:

Owner - The person who owns this option. Setting owner to 'any' means any
        immortal with access to SLAY can use it.
Color - Numerical value for the color of the messages sent.
        For now, use color 12 until a better method for setting colors
        can be found.
Cmessage - You will be put into the line editor to enter the message the
           user of the SLAY command will see.
Vmessage - You will be put into the line editor to enter the message the
           victim will see when slain.
Rmessage - You will be put into the line editor to enter the message the
           rest of the people in the room will see when someone is slain.

The slay editor uses the same variables as the social editor and the
mudprograms. See VARIABLES.

1 'SHADOW FOREST'~
#General Areas~
#END~
Very little is known about this patch of land because travelers,
adventurers, and soldiers pass it up because they like being alive.
Back about a century ago, a few travelers entered the forest.  Right
behind them was another group of travelers.  The first party barely
walked into the forest before they were engulfed by the shadows.  The
second party scared out of their mind did not move any further.  Seconds
later they heard screams of pain and horror coming from the forest, and
that was all it took for the party to disband and come running back to
Rafermand.  Since that, no one has ever attempted the forest.

1 SHEATH DRAW DRAWING SHEATHING~
#Combat~
#END~
Syntax: sheath
Syntax: draw [target]

New to Rafermand as of this helpfile is sheathing code.  You might of
seen it elsewhere in other muds, but it allows you to put a weapon in
a sheath and pull it out and wield it upon demand.  The "draw" command
allows you to draw a weapon from the sheath and wield and and the
"sheath" command allows you to withdraw the weapon from combat and
put it in your sheath.  Here are a few rules and pointers on how the
code works.

1.  Sheath must be worn to work, it goes on the waist and typically layes
    over the waist item.
2.  It is possible to wear 2 sheaths and a waist item.  You just need to
    play around with them to learn how to wear all 3.
3.  When you draw, you automatically draw to the wield position if you have
    dual wield.  So if you draw twice, make sure to have your primary weapon 
    in your first sheath.
4.  When you sheath, you will first sheath your dual wield weapon if you have
    one.
5.  Each sheath can only hold ONE weapon of a certain type and has a max weight
    limit on that weapon.  You can learn both of these values by examining it.
6.  Sheath's can break like containers, so repair them if needed.
7.  You can target a mob when you draw, just put in the name of the mob.  It will
    draw your weapon and attack.  Will not work on players yet though.
~

3 SHEATHRULES~
#Immortal Building BuildingObjs~
#END~
When making sheaths there are a few rules to go by to keep the world
in balance and make sure it doesn't cause problems with the code.
Here is what you need to keep in mind.

1.  Each item needs to be layered properly.  If it is a back item, it
    cannot be layered and should not.  As for the waist item, here is
    the layer values and what they can have/cannot have

layer 1 - Waist item, treat it as a normal item, can have affects.
layer 2 - Sheath, normal sheaths, no affects and no nogive flags.
layer 4 - Special Sheaths, little affects and nogive flag.

    It is possible to have a normal sheath on layer 4, it is not a good
    idea to have a special on on layer 2.  Also, layer 1 needs to be
    reserved for waist items only, so don't use that layer.  This works
    so that the lowest layer goes on first and then you put on layer 2
    and then layer 4.

2.  Wear locations have to be either back or waist.  Back doesn't have layers

3.  Unless it is layer 4, no affects.  If it is a layer 4, try to keep it to
    minimal affects, such as 10HP 1 str, very little or none.  If it isn't on
    a level 40 or higher mob, it shouldn't have affects.  Ask someone in the
    building council for more details on what is acceptable

4.  If a sheath has a nogive flag, it only accepts weapons with nogive flags to
    put into it.  It automatically searches for a sheath with a nogive flag if a
    weapon with a nogive flag on it is used during the sheath command.

5.  The sn value is used only if drawn during battle.  As of this helpfile writing,
    this value is not in use though, just provide it for future use.  Also, the sn
    can only be an attack spell, if it is found to be elsewise, someone will get
    screamed at very badly.

6.  If you provide a vnum for V2, only that weapon can be put into that sheath for it
    was made only for that weapon and any other one will not work.  These types of
    sheaths SHOULD NOT be made by anyone without consent of the building council or
    on occasion on a quest.  These types of sheaths usually have bonus affects because
    they are better and are the most rare kind of sheaths.

7.  If you leave the percent at 0, it defaults to a 25 percent chance.  Also, you are not
    to create a sheath with a spell on it without first asking.

0 SHIELD~
#Magic Mage Defensive~
#END~
Syntax: cast shield
Syntax: cast 'stone skin'

SHIELD provides an extra advantage at deflecting a blow (like with a shield).  The
stronger the spell, the greater the percent and duration.

STONE SKIN is a very powerful blessing that hardens the skin of the subject and reduces
total physical damage to the player with each blow.

 NOTE:  For information over shields, help SHIELDS
~

1 SHIELDBLOCK 'SHIELD BLOCK'~
#Combat~
#Combat Warrior BattleSkills~
#END~
Shield block is the skill of using a shield more affectively.  Those who are proficient
in this skill have an easier time blocking with a shield.  Over time, you can actually
increase the block percent of the shield you are using.
~

1 SHIELDS~
#Combat~
#END~
Shields are a common item in most muds.  However, in Rafermand we have changed
shields to play a slightly different role, one which you see in some games, and
in some you don't.

A shield comes in two varities, the 1-handed version and the 2-handed version.
The pavis (the one you can create) is the 2-handed version.  When one uses a
pavis they get the excellent durability and block percent of the shield, but
they cannot use any weapons while in battle, nor cast any spells, quaff potions,
brandish a staff, etc.  This is mostly useful for avoiding projectiles over a large
range.  One might think it is useful for tanking (taking all the damage in a fight),
but mobs are smarter than that and will start to attack a new target if they are
having problems with your shield.

The one-handed vareity come in different sizes.  From small bucklers to massive size
tower shields.  As one would expect, bucklers are harder to block with and break easier,
but they have their advantages.  Large shields take up something called lag time.  Just
like weapons have a certain lag time between battle, shields do too.  The larger the
shield, the more lag time.  So it is important to consider which shield is correct for
the situation.  On a final note, you cannot use two-handed weapons with shields.

Lastly, there is also a skilled call shieldblock in the Warrior sphere.  You can
increase your percent to block with all shields by increasing your skill in it.

Note:  Wearing a shield will make a mob less aggressive toward you.  This can be good or
bad depending on what you are looking for.

Syntax:  showpic <picture>

The first syntax is for immortals, the second is for players.  The immortal command
will take a type argument.  The only two options are all or room.  All sends it out
to everyone "PLAYING" the mud.  This simply means they are connected and not editing
a note, obj, etc.  This will only work for Zmud clients (as of this writing) and the
client has to have MXP enabled.

For picture the immortal has more options.  To tell it to load up a website picture
you simply type in the URL of it (a http:// will be provided if left out).  So you
just simply type http://www.rafermand.net/webimages/combat1.gif and the code will parse
it into a format MXP can understand.  A quite note to add, the version of Zmud I used
to test with this has some problems handling pictures that did not load due to incorrect
URL or some other problems.  What will happen is Zmud will cache it and store it in the
Zmud directory under the profile name you used to Connection (such as Rafermand) then
in an Images folder.  You should see a 0 KB file sitting there.  If you do you can only
get a new refresh of the picture to show up if it is deleted.  Also, sometimes that file
is not there and you cannot see the picture and you need to shutdown zmud and run it
again.  So the main words of wisdom, get the URL right the first time or you will be
having players asking how to fix it.

Lastly, an image can be pushed to a player or simply available online and then stored
in the Image Folder, then the picture can be pulled up at anytime for use.  Also, it
is best to stick to .gif and .jpg, not sure what else is supported (.jpeg will not work
BTW)

Your towns by default start out with 30k hold.  Hold is the amount of storage space
for resources.  1 Hold is calculated as 100 coins, 1 iron, 1 gold, 1 corn, 1 grain, 
1 lumber, or 1 stone.  Once you reach your maximum hold, you will not be able to
store the resources you have, this includes taxes.  In order to increase your hold
you need to purchase silos.  A silo is an actual room you have to dedicate on the
map.  The room doesn't have to be made with makeroom, but must be in your AOC (HELP
AOC).  Once created, the silo will hold the amount of resource indicated under
the buycaste command.  There is no placesilo command, as soon as the silo is purchased
it will be placed at the location you stand.

If you wish to remove a silo, just use the pave sectortype in build to be rid of the
silo.  The extra resource holding it was providing will be removed and any resources
you have over the new count will be removed on an even field (100 coins and then 1 of
each unit).  Be careful when you remove silos because of this function.

1 'SKILL POINTS' 'SKILL POINT' SPOINTS SPOINT~
#General~

Skill points are gained randomly after a successful battle.  They will
be gained most of the time, but not all the time.  You will gain more
points from defeating harder enemies (so you cannot just sit around and
smack down the easiest mobs in the game for a ton of points).  Once
you get enough points you can either increase your skills/spells by 1
star or a whole point (HELP TALENT) to learn more about the talent skill
used for that reason.

Since Rafermand is trying to encourage grouping, a new system has been
deviced for sharing skill points during a battle.  It is based on the
value you see in your score called your SWorth (HELP SWORTH).  You receive
a cut of the skill points in a group based on that.  For more rules reguarding
group cuts and rates check out the SWORTH helpfile.

Lastly, as you advance into Tier 2-4 skills/spells (HELP TIER) you will find
that the cost will go up.  It won't be a large increase, but an extra hurdle
standing in your way of advancement.
~

1 SKILLADVANCEMENT~
#General~
#END~
Our skill system offers two ways to advance a skill/spell.  You can either
just use it (rather in battle or not in battle depending on the type of
skill/spell) or you can use skill points toward advancing it.  Skill
points are gained after a successful win.  For more information over
Skill points see (HELP SKILL POINTS).  Once you earn enough of these
points you can use the command talent (HELP TALENT) to spend your points
on advancing one star or a whole point in any skill/spell that you
have available.  There are quite a few rules reguarding skill points
and groups, so please check the helpfile there for the rules.

Once you gain enough points you can eventually increase mastery and move
on to higher tiers (HELP MASTERY and HELP TIERS).

A skillgroup (sometimes called a group or a skill group or a spell group)
Is part of the hierachy of the skill system.  The hierarchy looks like this

   Sphere->SkillGroup->(Skill/Spell)

A skillgroup is actually what contains all the skills and spells and affects
how you can advance up in Tiers (HELP TIER).  Once you gained so many skills
to a certain requirement (again HELP TIER) you then are able to obtain
the next Tier of skills or spells.  This makes it possible to have Tier 4 in
one group an only Tier 2 in another group.

Each skill or spell has a point value.  You start at 1 and can go up
as far as 20.  As you increase the points (through use or the talent
command (HELP TALENT HELP SPOINTS)) you gain more power in that skill
or spell.  There is also mastery (HELP MASTERY) that affects the strength
of that skill/spell.  If you do not increase the mastery as soon as you
can (4 points for novice, 7 for expert, etc) you will find it harder to
gain points.  So, it is important to advance your mastery as soon as you
can.

~

1 SKILLREQUIREMENTS~
#General Skills~
#END~
In order to learn certain skills/spells in a group, you must first follow
a certain method to learn them.  Every group (well almost every group) will
require so many skills to be at a certain mastery before you can start learning
new skills.  This is how it works.

Skills are broke down into their mastery types.  When you type listgroups Fire
you will get a list of all the spells in Fire.  The Yellow are Beginner types, the
Cyan are Novice types, etc.  In order to start learning Novice type skills, you need
so many Beginner type skills at Novice.  To see how many you need, you can try to learn
a Novice type skill, or type listgroups toadvance <group>.  This will tell you how many
you need to learn the next mastery type.  It works the same with Expert, you will need

It is important to know a few things about the system, here are those
things.

 - It takes 0 points and 500 gold to get to Beginner
 - It takes 4 points and 3000 gold to get to Novice
 - It takes 7 points and 20000 gold to get to Expert
 - It takes 10 points and 100000 gold to get to Master
 - It takes 14 points and 500000 gold to get Elite
 - It takes 17 points and 2000000 gold to get Flawless
 - Spell groups require books to learn the spells
 
In addition to all of this, there can be extra cost if you are using a kingdom
trainer.  Kingdoms are allowed to tax the usage of their trainers, so it might
cost a bit more to use their trainer, or ungodly amounts more depending on the
value of the trainer.  In addition, there are additional requirements that are
listed in the learn helpfile (HELP LEARN).  It is a good idea to have read that
helpfile too.  Then there is the spheres helpfile (HELP SPHERES), again a good
read.

#Skills~

If you are looking for information over the skills command use (HELP SKILLSCOMMAND)
This is the main helpfile over the skill system of Rafermand.  This is one of the more
complex skills system available and it is also one of the most unique systems.  We offer
a sphere based system where you can learn skills/spells from 5 different spheres: Warrior,
Thief, Hand-to-Hand, Mage, Cleric.  Since we do not offer classes, you have the potential
to learn anything you want.  You can mix in a little bit of Thief into your Mage, or Mage
into your Thief, etc.  However, we have a counter-balancing system that makes it harder and
harder to learn things that are not in the same sphere.  So you can have a mage-thief, but
it will be harder to advance in skills/spells then with just a mage.  It gets even harder
if you have mage-cleric-thief.

For more information on how to actually advance in a skill, please check out the helpfile
(HELP SKILLADVANCEMENT).  This has changed recently offering two methods of advancement, via
talent command and by actual use.

This system is fairly complex and there are helpfiles listed
below that explain every aspect of this system.  It is HIGHLY recommended that you read them.

NOTE:  A new restriction has been added, HELP MASTERY RESTRICTIONS for more info.

1 SNEAK HIDE VISIBILE PRAWL LIGHTPRAWL NIGHTPRAWL~
#Combat Thievery Thiefskills~
#END~
Syntax:  hide
Syntax:  sneak
Syntax:  visible
 
Hide is a variety of skills combining hide, prawl, nightprawl, and lightprawl.  All 4
are in the Stealth group and gain in use/power as you go up.  Hide is the most basic
version that allows you to hide anywhere as long as it is nighttime.  However, you cannot
move with just the hide skill (note fairies can hide natually with no knowledge of the
skill).  The next step up, prawl, allows you to move while hidden as long as it is night
and the sector isn't a road/path.  The next skill up (nightprawl) allows free movement
at night and lightprawl allows free movement in the light.

There is a slight chance of losing your hidden status while moving with all 3 of the skills
so keep an eye on your hidden status as you move.

Sneak is useful if you want to move silently without players noticing you moving
through the room.  If you flee, you will stop sneaking and will have to 'sneak' again.

Visible (vis) cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
effectively making you visible again to all.

1 SORES SORE~
#Combat~
#Magic~
#END~
Sores are mainly a scripting blocking mechanism to prevent a player
from simply getting the hell beat out of them to collect hp.  Depending
on your race, after so many attacks, you will start to develop sores.
After this time, you will need to sleep to get yourself healed enough
so you can take more hits.  This typically requires about 3-5 minutes
of sleeping.

If you continue to take hits while you have sores, you will start to lose
points toward gaining health, and will eventually lose health.

Note:  It is also possible to gain mana sores if you cast too many spells
in a short time.  When it comes to taking the most sores, ogres can take
the most damage and fairies can cast the most without getting mana burn.

1 SPAM~
#General Laws~
#END~
No, we are not talking about a luncheon meat here.  Spam is the repeated use
of a phrase, command, or channel that causes screen scroll for others.  Not
only is spam considered rude, but excessive screen scroll can interfere with
the game play of anyone seeing it (not to mention combat situations).  The
game will also tell you to PUT A LID ON IT and force-quit you after the 20th
repeat of a single command
 
It is also considered spam to use the same phrase over several different
channels.  The use of all-caps can also be considered spam.  Only use
capitals to add emphasis to key words in a sentence.
 
Moving a large number of items into and out of a container in a crowded, 
non-store room is considered spam.  Using multiple characters to chat the
same message at the same time is considered spam.  Making charmed mobs
or pets to cause screen scroll through movement or orders is considered
spam. ANYTHING that causes excessive or irritating screen scroll can be
considered spam.

#Skills~
#Magic~
#Combat~
#END~
&w&GFollowing off with the last statement, Mage is done this way for a few reasons. Mages 
will find it difficult at first to master their craft. Tier 1 spells (help TIERS) are 
rather weak and do little damage and require mana that you simply do not have. It is much 
easier to take a trusty Steel weapon and bash a beast over the head with it, but it 
requires patiences and training to develop a good mage. In addition, this creates a bit 
of disbalance if you try to pick up other spheres with Mage. You will find yourself 
having difficult keeping them balanced because of the requires for the next Spheres 
compared to the requirements in the other spheres. Cleric is the second worst, but 
contains less than half of the spells available in the Mage sphere. When it comes to the 
other 3 spheres, they contain a bit less than the Cleric sphere, so you won't find 
yourself investing as much points into skills. However, you have automated skills in 
these 3 spheres that do not require you to physically use them, and other skills like 
attack skills (roundhouse) that you use over and over to inflict blows. You might not 
have a good balance of points in these spheres, but you will find them easier to learn. 
This can be both a good thing and a bad thing, depending on Sphere dominance. 

&w&WThe skill system distributes learning in two ways. First, it goes by spheres.&w&G 
This will take the percentage of points you have in each sphere and multiply it by the 
gain you get when you use a skill or spell. If 40 percent of your points are in Mage, 
when you use a Mage sphere spell, you will get 40 percent of the normal increase if you 
had 100 percent. This increase is what you see indicated by the * in &c&wskills 
magic&w&G. So, back to the first helpfile, this is why it takes 3 times longer because 
you are only getting 33 percent a pop. If you had something like 45 45 10, you would get 
45 percent in one, 45 percent in the other, and 10 percent in the last one. &w&RThis 
works as long as you do not have a dominant sphere. A dominant sphere is a sphere where 
you have the majority of total points in all skills/spells. This means if you have 220 
points combined from all skills/spells, and you have 111 points in Mage, Mage will be 
classified as your dominant sphere. &w&GThere are some pros/cons to this setup, and they 
are listed in the next helpfile. 

                      ---------Continued in Sphere3---------
~

1 SPHERE3 SPHERES3~
#Skills~
#Magic~
#Combat~
#END~
&w&GAs mentioned before, a dominant sphere is one with the majority of the points. You 
will find a lot of the time players will fall into this catagory if they are working with 
mage spells. It is possible to fall dominant into the other 4 spheres, but it gets 
difficult to go without some sort of spells. More skills will be introduced down the road 
for the other spheres to help balance some of this out, but for now, this is what we 
have. When you have a dominant sphere, instead of getting the 80 percent or so because 80 
percent of your points are in Mage, it starts to break things down Group by Group. If you 
spend all your points in Earth, you will get 100 percent of those spells in Earth. This 
is reguardless if you have 51 percent in Mage of 98 percent in Mage. However, this is 
where things start to get a little dirty. If you are split up 50 and 50 between Earth and 
Air you will get 65 percent in both groups. The formula for that is as follows. 30 + (.7 
* Percent). So 30 + (.7 * 50) = 65. You will get 65 percent in both groups. If you are 
33, 33, 33 in three groups, you get 53.7 in each group. This system allows you to get a 
minimum of 30 percent in any group no matter how many points you have in that group. In 
addition to this, spells/skills in your master sphere suffer 1/3 of loss in points from 
not using them. This decrease could be good or bad depending if you are trying to lose 
skills/spells in that sphere. Just have to always remember, this all works if you have a 
majority of points in one sphere. 

Lastly, it is important to remember a few "exception" rules that exist, and some are to 
your benefit. 

&w&R1. If you get no skills/spells in other spheres, you are considered a specialist and 
get 100 percent gain in all groups in that sphere. As soon as you gain another point 
outside the sphere, it is broken. You could do a sphere this way to gain quickly, but 
when you go to learn another sphere, you are going to be in for a rude awakening because 
you will find yourself below the 1 percent range on the other spheres. Use at your own 
risk. (Best used with constant grouping of specialized characters) 
    
2. If you don't have any skills/spells over 5 points or in Novice you will be in "Newbie 
mode". Newbie mode allows you to gain 100 percent if it is the majority sphere (or group 
if it is dominant sphere) or 70 percent if not. This will change as soon as you fall into 
5 points or novice in a skill/spell 
    
&w&GWell that is all for now, rest assured that you know this complex system, or atleast 
you have some idea now.

1 SPHERES~
#Skills~
#Magic~
#Combat~
#END~
Rafermand's skill/spell system is broken down into sections called Spheres. As of the 
writing of this helpfiles, those 5 spheres are: Mage, Cleric, Hand-to-Hand, Thief, and 
Warrior. The spheres represent the basic 4 classes along with hand-to-hand combat. I 
could of chose names that didn't correspond to the classes, but I thought it would be 
easier for newbies to get the idea of what is involved in each Sphere. 

Along with the spheres there are groups. In Mage you have Fire, Earth, Water, Air, and 
Energy (help ELEMENTS help MAGIC). In Cleric you have the same 5 along with Divine. The 
other 3 spheres have their own unique groups as well. Groups are similiar spells that are 
grouped together for a certain purpose that will be explained later. For now, just 
remember that groups are the actual groupings of spells/skills under the sphere level. 

Now that you know what exactly a sphere is, lets look at why it is important to 
understand this information. The Rafermand skill system works on a unique system in which 
you can learn anything you want because of the lack of classes. However, in order to make 
this fair so you cannot master everything, the system counter-balanced. This roughly 
means if you take 3 spheres (say Warrior, Mage, Cleric) and spend the same amount of 
points (points are the points you have in say shield, like 2, shows up in skills magic) 
you will find it 3 times harder to learn in all 3 of those spheres instead of just 
learning in 1. In AD&&D you find that if you want to be a multi-class character you must 
absorb the experience base for both classes. This works the same way here. In order to 
learn all 3 of the spheres, you must invest the amount of time it would take to advance 3 
characters who are working on 1 sphere only. This only really works with 3 or more 
spheres and you keep the points equal. You will often find yourself with more points in 
Mage if you develop that sphere because of the abundance of spells in it.

1 SPINKICK~
#Combat HandtoHand~
#END~
A simple strike to the head that involves spinning around and striking the target's
head with the side of one's foot.  It can cause more damage than a roundhouse because
of the extra momentum of the spin, but lacks the raw power of a tornadokick.

1 SPIRITUAL~
#General~
#END~
Spiritual sphere is the practice of using one's energy to do great things in and out
of battle.  Combining the unarmed combat attacks of the strikes offered in this sphere
along with the skills available in the other 2 groups, those who master the spiritual
sphere will find a good mix of the other 4 spheres available in their own skills.  The
only weaknesses of this group lie in most of their skills are not automatic skills like
that of the Combat sphere, but must be activated to use.  In addition, a lot of the
enchantments available in spell form tend to be stronger than theirs, but if you are
alone in the middle of great danger, it is a great sphere to have mastered.

Sprint is no longer a command, but run will still work. Below are the 
directions for run. 

RUN allows you to move more than one time in any direction, it works some 
like this (run 10e2ns). This would be 10 east, 2 north, 1 south. You can 
also move ne, se, etc by using n+e, s+e, etc. So (run 2n+es) would run two 
northeast and one south. 

Also, in the run parsing, you can use o to open a direction. It will only 
work like "open north", so you won't be able to use "open door" with run. A 
line with the open option looks like this (run 2non2e) 2 north, open north, 
2 east. 

Directions:
north = n     south = s    east = e     west = w
northeast = n+e or e+n   northwest = n+w or w+n
southeast = s+e or e+s   southwest = s+w or w+s

1 STABLE STABLES~
#Wilderness Mounts~
#END~
Stables are special tracks of land you can buy on the Wilderness for
placing a Stable.  In order to place a stable, you need to go to the
local caste official in your town (in Rafermand that is w of recall)
and buy a S class license.  Once you do so, you can go out to the
Wilderness and use the command makestable to place a stable.  The
rules for building one is that you have to stand in a room next to
the room you want to have the stable in, and type makestable dir.
Also, the stable has to be created in plains, hills, or fields.  Once
you have created the stable, you can use the stable command to use the
stable.

The stable command has 5 options you can use
      build store list retrieve release

build    - Add 3 more slots for mounts (you get 3 initially).  You need a
           S Additional License to do this (get from caste guy).
store    - Can place your mount in the stables (has to be a saveable mount)
list     - List the current mounts in the stables
retrieve - Retrieve the mount from the stable (uses the number from list)
release  - Release your current mount into the Wilderness.

As of now, that is all that is available.  Later there will be options to
add to allow traiding so you can let people come in and take one of yours
in trade for money (which will become a job later on).
Just remember, making stables only work if you are in the Wilderness and
have the S Class License.

 Note: The direction you type when you create the stable is where the link on
the Wilderness will be, in the actual stable, the link back out will be opposite
of that direction.  So if you type makestable e, the entrance will be to the
east and the exit to the west.

1 STARTFIRE FLINT~
#General~
#END~
Syntax:  startfire

Startfire is the difficult way of starting a fire (the easy way would be
using the spell create fire).  Starting a fire the normal way requires
a knife like weapon, some tinder, and a flint.  The knife and the flint
you can purchase in town (the knife being a copper knife, etc).  The tinder
can either be purchases or you can use the command gathertinder out in a
highly populated area of trees (HELP GATHERTINDER).  If you have all of the
following items you will get a chance to start a fire.  If you have no
skill in startfire, it will take an ungodly amount of tries to start a
fire, so if you plan on starting a fire, learn the skill.

Once a fire is started the tinder will be replaced with some fire.

The mother function for creating a kingdom.  It costs nothing to start a kingdom
if you are playing ToC.  All you need to do iis go into the wilderness and stand at
the spot you want to create the kingdom dat.

Here are some tips on starting a kingdom.

1.  You only have 3 months worth of food, do not start during a time you
    will not be able to harvest food in a relatively short amount of time.
    (help HARVEST for harvest details).
2.  It is a good idea to be near both mountains and forests.  Having it
    within 10 squares is always a good thing.
3.  Being near a road is good, you need roads to trade and it saves the money
    of having to build one.  If you don't plan on being connected to the rest
    of the word, perhaps far away from the road is a good idea.
4.  Check the area for other kingdoms, being too close to another kingdom could
    be seen as an act of aggression.
5.  Read the helpfiles.  Help kingdom commands and read every single helpfile.  Seek
    as much help as you can when starting out, the system is rather large.

1 'STATS'~
#General Information Stats~
#END~
Since rafermand is a levelless mud (HELP LEVELS) we feature different ways to increase and
decrease stats (hp, str, int, etc).  Each stat in itself is important in certain areas and
you might want to only focus on a few stats because you might not really need some of the
others.  Each stat has its own helpfile, which is listed below, but each stat works somewhat
like this.

Each time you use a trigger effect (something that increases or decreases a stat) it either
loses or gains a few points.  Once it reaches the max, it goes up one point, or when it goes
to 0, it decreases a point.  Each stat is different in how this happens and how fast, but
all of them do this.  To see the status of a stat you might be working on, you can type
(gscore) (HELP GSCORE).  It will give you an idea on how well you are doing on increasing
a stat.  It will be up to you to figure out the best way to increase your stats, and figure
out the limits you have on how much you can increase it and HOW FAST.  Some stats will only
let you go so fast on it before it starts to remove points.  This is discussed in each helpfile
for the stat, so start reading below.

You can only steal coins from players if you are in a noloot or higher zone.
You can only steal items from players if you are in a fullloot zone.

As with most agent skills, being hidden to the enemy will greatly increase your

Stun is a skill which can only be used once a fight has started.  It will 
stun your opponent for a short time.  When stunned, the target will not attack
back and will be extremely open for attacks.  Also, during this time you can
take the chance to step out of combat using the stepback command (HELP STEPBACK).
If the enemy is not aggressive it will leave you alone after you stop the fight,
otherwise it will hunt you down after awakening.

daze is pretty much the same as stun but it doesn't low the ac as much and it
has a lower chance to land and a shorter duration.

Both are susceptible to saves versus paralysis and any immune mobs to paralysis.
Lastly, the chance of landing either on a player is greatly reduced and strength/dex
influences your chance to land a stun/daze.

1.  The target is in the same area as the caster.
2.  The corpse is in the same area as the caster.
3.  The caster has a Divine Idol.

The Divine Idol is used up in most casting, but as you increase your skill
in the spell you get a slight chance of saving it for a future casting.  You can

1 SWORTH~
#General~
#END~
Sworth is a value generated based on all the stats you have not including
your worth (gold/bank) and what equipment you have on you (for some obvious
reasons).  The formula is weighted more toward skill advancement than stat
advancement, but having both will not hurt you here.  Besides this value to
explain the strength of your character, it is used in other purposes.

1.  It controls the cut of Skill points you get when grouped.  You get a share
    of the cut based on your percent of SWorth in the group.  If you have 200
    SWorth and your friend has 100, you get 66 percent and your friend 33.
2.  It controls bonuses you get with being in a group.  A group gets bonus skill
    points as long as the lowest SWorth in the group is not more than half the
    the highest (so if you have a 200 150 170 the lowest you can take is a 100
    without losing your group cut).

Number 2 is mainly done to prevent a group of 8 with a 10,000 and a bunch of 100s
for the sole purpose of getting the 10k a lot more points.  Due ot the nature of
the cut, if you have a lot of lower SWorths they won't get much of anything and
you won't get any bonuses.

Syntax:  talent <stat name> spend point
Syntax:  talent list [obtained]
Syntax:  talent purchase <number>

Talent is used to increase a skill, a stat, or spend spoints toward an
actual talent.  A talent is something such as increasing a max stat
value or a special skill that is available to everyone or simply your
race.  The first part of the syntax involves skills/spells.  You can
spend either a star (1/10 of a point) or a full point.  You can use
the available option to see how many stars and/or points you can
purchase and then you can use cost to see how much it will cost.

Next part is the stat section.  Same options here, only thing of note
is cost for stats are mainly dependant on your hp/mana.  As you gain
more and more it will cost you move to increase any of your stats.  Then
again, as you get more and more hp you should be getting more and more
spoints.

Lastly, the list and purchase arguments are for purchasing talents.  Talents
are as simple as increasing the cap (max) on a stat.  Each race has a certain
limit for each stat (humans can go all the way up the increase scale on all
stats, this is part of their racial bonus).  Without giving it all away, it
is like the starting value for a stat.  Ogres can max the scale on hp/str but
won't get very far in int/mana.  Fairies are the exact opposite.  Elves tend
to go up the scale well in all areas.  Dwarves do well in all areas as well
and Hobbits do well in dex/agi but are average in the other areas.  There
is an optional argument for list to show what talents you have purchased.

You can find help for everything but mountains and desert in (HELP BUILD2).
The following applies to all of the above commands.

Terraform allows you to modify the land around your kingdom to suit it better
to your needs.  Build is more of a town building command where terraform is
used to change the world around you (it can, however, be used in both a world
and town situation of course).  All these commands will work in your own kingdom
or in any unclaimed land in the world.  It requires only the minbuild or carpenter
job for restrictions.  

For more help over terraforming mountains and deserts, (HELP TERRAFORM2)

1 TERRAFORM2~
#General~
#END~
Syntax:  terraform mountains
Syntax:  terraform desert

Not everyone has beautiful flat ground not full of sand to build a settlement on,
so these commands are available to help flatten out the land.  Terraforming
these sectors, unlike the others, require an actual amount of time to complete
and require a bit more resources than the others (perhaps the expection of laying
down a bridge).  So, without any delay...

Mountains allows you to terraform a mountain sector or an empty resource sector (no
resources left in an iron or gold mine) into a plains sector.  The cost to terraform
a mountain sector is 40k coins and 5k stone.  Once the process is in place, it will
take roughly 6 Game months for it to finish.

Desert allows you to terraform either a desert sector or a shore sector.  This process
is a bit less costly than a mountain sector, 8k coins, 1k stone, but that is within
your AOC.  To pay for the extra cost outside of AOC, you pay 20k coins per sector.
It takes 2 Game Months to finish.

NOTE:  Can now terraform empty stone sectors.  Same usage/cost as Mountains/Gold/Iron

So in short, this chart should help

0 TICK~
#General Information~
#END~
Many of the actions in the Realms are based upon interval timers, including
combat, most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell
duration, weather, and area resetting.
 
Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks in these Realms average 60 seconds of real time, but the
actual amount varies randomly from 45 seconds to 75 seconds.
 
Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if there are no characters in
in the area; less often (15 minutes) if any characters are present; Also,
some lower level areas have shorter reset periods, while some higher level
areas have longer reset periods.
 
Note that objects lying on the ground will not be regenerated if anyone is
in the area when it resets.
 
Area resets are indicated by 'squeaking noises' or other messages just prior
to the reset itself.

1 TIER TIERS TIER1 TIER2 TIER3 TIER4~
#Skills~
#END~
In the magic/skill system there are sets of spells and skills that fall into something called
a tier.  There are 4 tiers: Tier 1 Tier 2 Tier 3 Tier 4.  The first tier is the weakest of the 4
tears with Tier 4 being the strongest.  In order to advance up to the next Tier, you will need so
many of the previous Tier to a certain mastery: x amount of Tier 1 at Novice, x amount of Tier 2
at Expert, x amount of Tier 3 at Master (HELP MASTERY).  In order to find the x in this value, you
need to use listgroups toadvance <group> (HELP LISTGROUPS).  Once you complete your requirement for
the next tier, you can learn any spell/skill in that group's Tier.  If you even fall out of this
requirement, you will not be able to learn *ANY NEW* skills/spells in that Tier.  However, you can
still advance in the ones that you have started to learn.  A lot of times it is important to get rid
of lower Tier spells/skills that are useless but only to advance in Tier.  You can do this by not
using it, and in time it will disappear.

It is important to remember that a Tier 3 spell at Beginner might be better than a Tier 1 spell
at Expert or even Master, so just because you have a high mastery rating in a spell/skill doesn't
make it better than a higher Tier spell/skill.  It is important to find a group or two you like and
try to climb the Tiers as quickly as possible to get to the Tier 3 spells, and perhaps the Tier 4
spell if you element allows it (HELP ELEMENTS).

To see what tier a spell or skill is in, all you need to do is use listgroups <group>.  This will show
you a listing of every spell and skill in a certain group.  You should notice some colors with each
spell/skill.  &c&YYELLOW is Tier1  &cDark Cyan is Tier2  &CBright Cyan/Blue is Tier3  &RRed is Tier4

3 TIMERESETS~
#Immortal Building Resets~
#END~
In order to add a timereset to a mobile or object, you need to use the
reset time command.  Its syntax is as followed.

Syntax:  reset time <number> <time to reset>  --in seconds
Syntax:  reset time left <number>             --Shows Time Left till Reset
Syntax:  reset time forcereset <number>       --Sets the time to reset to now, will reset next reset area tick

It is important to remember a few rules when adding time based resets.

1.  Setting TTR (time to reset) to 0 removes the time reset function from a reset.
2.  Setting TTR to -1 makes it load only once.
3.  Setting TTR > 0 sets it to a time based reset.
4.  Resets do not load as soon as the TTR triggers.  It is reset every time the next
    reset area tick comes by.  So if you have a lot of time based resets, you might set
    and area's reset ticks to 1 minute.
5.  Time based resets do not actually go into affect till the mob/object is loaded by the
    reset code.  So in short, if the mob/obj is loaded once you set the resets, you need to
    purge the mobs/objs to make sure the time based reset is in action.
6.  Time based resets are triggered by 3 actions for objs and 1 for mobs.  The 3 actions for objs
    are obj_from_obj, obj_from_char, obj_from_room.  This means if an item is disarmed, stollen, junked
    destroyed, loaded to a corpse, or moved in any fashion, it is triggered.  Mobs are triggered by
    extract_char.  This is called anytime a mob is killed or removed from the game (purge)
7.  Time based resets of -1 are removed from the reset list once they are triggered.  If you don't want
    this to happen, set the time to something like 300mil seconds (10 years) so you can choose to reinstate
    it later.

1 TOWN TOWNS~
#Kingdoms~
#END~
Towns are the main units of the kingdom.  There are two levels of a kingdom,
the kingdom wide settings and the town settings.  The kingdom has a default
town that some taxes are pumped into from across the kingdom.  This default
town is setup by default as the first town you create using startkingdom.
You can, however, change this using the townvalues command.  

Towns can be controlled by two factions, the mayor of the town, and those
who have the ranking in the kingdom to control towns no matter of who
controls them.  Just like in kingdoms, there are certain values and permissions
you can grant with a town, these are done with the townvalues command
(HELP TOWNVALUES).

Lastly, towns now each can control their own units.  The barracks have been
moved from the kingdom and into each town.  These units can be controlled
by the town owners or those who have command of troops.  Units can be
purchased by using coins earned from taxes from a kingdom (HELP TOWNSIZE) for
more information over things like units and moral.

If you are looking to start a town, talk to your King and ask for a Mayor's License
so you can get started on your new town.  The cost of a new town are as such.

80000 gold coins
30000 units of Lumber
20000 units of Stone

In order to create a new town, you need to have the permission from a town in
the kingdom to expand from.  They first need to set their expansion permissions
on and then you need to be connected to the town via a road.  If either one of
these is not ready, you will not be able to start a new town.  Once this is done,
the resources will be removed from the town you are expanding from, and depending
on the size, the town might decrease in size.  If the Expansions value in townvalues
is 0, the town will decrease, otherwise, the town will stay the same size.  It is
best to expand from larger cities because they can be expanded from without a loss.

amount of resources needed to increase moral (HELP MORAL), the different kinds of
units you can purchase along with the speed of training for that unit, and lastly
how many rooms you can build in your town (HELP BUILD HELP MAKEROOM).  To make things
short, here is a small table.

Color being: red pink yellow cyan white green

Track will assist you in tracking down a mob that is within the area,
giving you its general direction.
Track also works out in the wilderness giving you the general direction
of the target.

New in 2.1.2 is the ability to track mobs in a while area.  Instead of
returning a direction in which to track the target, it will spit out a
list of mobs in the area.  The mobs will be labeled with a color according
to how close the enemy is.  In order of closest to furthest, the colors are
as follows:  Red Pink Yellow Cyan White Green.  It is possible if your track
skill is low that you won't see White or Green.  Also, till you master
track you will always get a slightly different list, so it might be a good idea
to master it as soon as you can.  Also, you can narrow down the list by providing
a color you want to look for.  When you specify that color none of the other colors
will show up on the list.  You can specify multiple colors (ex: track area red pink).
Lastly, this also works out in the wilderness but the distance is much more exact
so you might not be able to track huge distances like in a normal area.

-----------------------Below are for trading between towns--------------------------
Syntax: tradegoods town take <name of town> <item> <number>.
Syntax: tradegoods town give <name of town> <item> <number>.

Following command is used to trade resources between kingdoms or towns in your own kingdom.

In order to trade between kingdoms you need to first start a trading offer.  Once you start
a trade between another kingdom, you use set to make an offer of what you want and what
you are willing to give.  Once you have set the correct values, you can send it to the other
kingdom (you can remove a resource by setting it to 0).  Once it is send to the other kingdom
they can either accept it or set it to another value and send it back.  The trade will continue
as long as it doesn't surpass the 3 day time limit or if it is accepted or declined.  Once a
trade is sent, you cannot alter it.  If you make a mistake, you can decline it and start it
allover again.

You can use the tradegoods list comand to see all active trades.  The first two lines are rather
easy to figure out, the last line shows a few different things.  It looks like this

[1  ] Offering - [ ]Arcadia      Receiving - [X]Radakia       Sent[ ]   Side[Offering]

It shows the offering and receiving kingdom.  The X before their name indicated if they
have the resources available that they are offering.  The Send field indicates that it has
been sent to the other kingdom for accepting, and the side indicates who has the trade proposal
at this moment.

***NOTE*** Trades will not be undone because you made a mistake, make sure to check to see if you
have the correct offers before you send it.

The last two commands for town trading was moved from townvalues to this command.  It allows you
to tradegoods between two towns in your town.  Anyone can give resources to another town, but
only the king and number1 and number2 and take from a town.

Lastly, in order to use this command, the towns have to be connected.  In order to trade
between two kingdoms, the default towns of the kingdoms have to be connected via a road.

1 TRADEROUTES~
#Kingdoms Management~
#END~
Syntax:  traderoutes

Trading is a very important feature of intrakingdom management and trading
between other kingdoms.  In order to move goods back and forth between towns
they need to be connected via roads.  Traderoutes uses a route algorithm I
aquired for use for this system.  It will check if two points are connected
via a road.  The range is 70 rooms in any direction.  If the two points are
greater than 70 rooms, they are not considered connected (so keep that in mind
if you start connecting up your towns or a road between two trading kingdoms).

When it comes to connecting kingdoms, the route is calculated between the two
default towns.  If you want to trade between two kingdoms, it is probably best
for the kingdoms to set their default towns to the two towns closest to
eachother.  The system will not use a "hoping" system like town X is connected
to town Y and town Y is connected to town Z so town Z is connected to town X.  This
will not work, so you will have to make sure your default towns are directly
connected to eachother.

To trade between towns and kingdoms you use the command tradegoods (help TRADEGOODS)

1 'TRAIL OF BLOOD'~
#General Areas~
#END~
A cursed area of myth.  It is rumored a great battle took place in this wretched
forest, and the dead souls were trapped into the forest along with their great
general.  Blood soaks the grounds of this forest, along with the massive amounts
of the undead.  It is also rumored anyone who visited this place did not come back
alive.  For this reason, not much else is known.

1 TRAINER TRAINERS~
#Skills~
#END~
Trainers are used to learn new skills/spells or used to advance in mastery
in a new skill/spell.  To learn a new skill all you need is the amount listed
by the trainer to learn it, for a spell you need the amount along with a
spellbook of that spell.

For advancing in mastery, the requirements are as follow.

Novice - 4 points + money
Expert - 7 points + money
Master - 10 points + money

3 TRAINER TRAINERS TCREATE TDELETE TSET TSTAT~
#Immortal Building Trainers~
#END~
Trainers are pretty much normal mobs with the ability to teach Mastery to
the players.  You create a trainer much like you create a shopkeeper.
The commands involved with trainers are.

tcreate
tdelete
tset
tstat
learn

You use tcreate to create a trainer, and tdelete, to delete a trainer.
You uset tset to set a trainers values, and tstat to view em.  Learn is the
command for players, and when setting a trainer, tstat should be used mainly.
Only thing to note about this is when you create a trainer, it automatically
sets the PACIFIST, SENTINEL, CASTEMOB, TRAINER flags, and when you delete the
trainer it removes those flags (it does not delete the mob either).  So if you
want to have the trainer wander, remove the pacifist flag, etc.
~

1 TRAINING~
#Kingdoms Military~
#END~
Syntax:  training list [town]
Syntax:  training remove <number>

When you first purchase a unit, it is placed in the training queue to receive the
training it needs to perform its function.  This can take anywhere from 7.5 Game
Days to over a Game Year for the most advanced units.  Once a unit is placed in
the training queue, you are charged for the initial cost of the unit.  You can remove
the unit from the queue and receive back half of the cost if you feal it is wasting
resources or you need the queue spot back.

If you check townvalues, you will notice two values toward the bottom, Units and
Training.  Units is the maximum number of units you can possess in a single town
and Training is the maximum amount of units you can have training at one time.  As
your town grows in size (HELP TOWNSIZE) it will be able to hold more units and also
train more units at the same time.

Once a unit is finished training, it will be placed at the barracks and be awaiting
orders or in the case of a worker unit, it will be placed at the point where you
did a placemob.  For more information over Worker Units (help WORKERUNITS).

Trap command is the mother command of configuring and placing traps on objects.  Trap is
available for use for anyone that is of building level and can be used to apply traps to
any object that is in your area's assigned range.  Only the highest level immortals can
apply traps to objects that are not in his/her assigned range.  Unlike the old trap code,
a trap can exist on a single object, not inside of a container.  This allows for a variety
of methods for triggering a trap.  Also, an object that is stored on a character will save
any trap on it, so it will remain trapped till it is detrapped, runs out of charges, or
the trap blows up the object.  For more information over traps, lets continue to (HELP TRAP2)
~

7 TRAP 2~
#General~
#END~
~

3 TRAP2~
#General~
#END~
Trap set        - Creates and applies a trap to the object specified.  The trap is reset 
                  into the area and will fire when the object is reset.
Trap set simple - Only the important options, does the same thing as trap set.
Trap create     - Creates a trap, but does not apply it.  Can then apply the trap later
                  and set its options using trap edit
Trap show       - Shows all the traps.  Will discuss the options later.
Trap apply      - Applies a trap to an object.  This will install a reset for the trap
                  into the area that it belongs to.  Make sure to save/fold after doing
                  any applies
Trap add        - Same as trap set but it does not apply the trap to an object
Trap delete     - Deletes a trap along with any resets or applies.
Trap edit       - Used to edit any trap available

In short, you use trap set to create the trap and then apply a reset to that object.  You
use create or add to simply create the reset and apply it later.  Apply is used to apply
a trap reset to an object when a trap already exists.  A trap is armed on an object by
default everytime the object is reloaded (so if the object is not picked up from a room it
will not reset till a reboot or the object is purged).  The option of resetvalue can be
set to 1 to force it to rearm/recharge every time the area resets.

Note:  Using set or apply to an object in your inventory will set it as a personal
trap and will save that information on your pfile or to whomever the trap ends
up on.  There will be no reset installed this way.  Resets will be installed if
the obj is in any other state.

(SEE HELP TRAP3 for more info
~

3 TRAP3~
#General~

charges       - Number of remaining charges left.
maxcharges    - Maximum number of charges on the trap.  When the trap is rearmed/recharged it
                will be set to this value.
type          - See (HELP TRAPTYPES).  Explosion or Blade is common.  Only 1 type per trap
damlow        - Low amount of damage.
damhi         - High amount of damage.
room          - Default is 0.  Setting it to 1 will damage everything in the room.
difficulty    - Difficulty to detrap.  Range is 0 to 300.  Setting it to anything over 100
                will make it impossible to detrap without a toolkit.
toolkit       - See (HELP TOOLKIT).  Toolkits are used to disarm a trap.
onetime       - Default is 0.  Setting it to 1 will delete the trap/reset after it fires
                just once.
resetvalue    - Default is 0.  Setting it to 1 will rearm/recharge the trap every time the
                area resets (compared to every time the trapped object is loaded)
toolnegate    - Value the tool will negate from the difficulty.  It can be more or less
                than the difficulty.
frag          - Range is 0 - 100.  Anything over 0 gives a percent chance that the firing
                of the trap will destroy the trapped object.  Setting it to 100 is a 100
                percent chance, setting it to 1 is a 1 percent chance.
flags         - See (HELP TRAPFLAGS).

blinding attacks.
~

1 TRUEEYE~

3 TRUST~
#Immortal ImmPlayers~
#END~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~

1 TUMBLE~
#Combat Thievery Combatskills~
#END~
Tumble is an automatic skill that works with dodge.  Tumble will add to
your ability to dodge if you are wearing no armor or leather armor.  If you
are a hobbit, this does include light armor.  If you are able to tumble, you
will see a message stating you are tumbling instead of dodging.  Both dodge
and tumble will increase with the use of this skill.
~

1 TWINK~
#General~
#END~
For starts, if you are unfamiliar with the word Twink, here is a brief description. It is
MUD jargon for a person that steps outside of his/her RP bounds to show his/her superpowers.
In a more PKill oriented game it simply means a person who likes to kill individuals much
weaker than he/she. Lastly, if you googled the word twink you will probably notice some
links to gay porn sites. It also is word uses in the gay culture, which probably was used
as a rather nasty insult by some 15 year old to another *laugh*.

Twink killing is the art of killing people who are weaker than you. Typically it is in
regard to killing newbies just because you can. This does not create a very healthy
learning experience for newbies so the game will not allow it. However, there are different
situations where you can kill someone who is weaker than you.

1. You are challenged to a duel. There are no checks here.
2. The person you are attacking has a cloak on and is hooded. A person that is hidden like
   such is treated as an equal in this check (but not in Power Ranking)
3. If the person is involved in a kingdom that is at war with your kingdom. There are no
   rules here due to the nature of being in a kingdom that is suppose to be protecting and
   arming you.
4. You are in an arena. These areas are a free for all and will not count.

Twink killing will be defined by killing anyone that is more than 5 Power Levels below your
own. You will know this value unless the person is cloaked so it is not like you will not
know. Once the twink killing is committed, twink points will be assigned to your characters
depending on the nastiness of the death (anywhere from 5-25 points). If you collect 100
points your character will be reset. You have the right to contest a twink point add, but
you take the risk of the immortal adding more twink points if you are trying to cheat the
system (or even worse).

On a final note, the twink check is started at the beginning of a battle and will be assigned
based on that value. This value will be reset anytime a fight is broken up (flee, etc). This
prevents some cheating of the system by removing all of ones equipment before death to stack
on a stiff penalty.
~

3 UNFOLDAREA~
#Immortal Building BuildingSetup~
#END~
Syntax:  unfoldarea <area filename>
 
This command will load up an area file.
 
NOTE:  It could be quite dangerous to unfold an area that is already
       loaded, or one that has not been tested.
 
~

1 UNIQUE NOGIVE~
#General~
#END~
Unique applies to an item that is flagged unique.  An unique flag simply
means only 1 instance of that item can be on a pfile at a time.  This
will check all our containers and your bank to make sure this is true.

Nogive simply means you cannot get rid of it without junking it.  Items
like this are typically flagged because immortals do not want the item
to be shared with others.  Typically this comes along with a nodrop flag
to prevent dropping.  There are checks for just about everything to prevent
transfer of a nogive item.
~

1 UNITS~
#Kingdoms~
#Kingdoms Military~
#END~
Units are anything you purchase with buycaste mobs.  A unit is typically a military unit
under which you can control using command and giveorders.  Also included in this general
term are worker units (HELP WORKERUNIT).  You don't have as much control over these units,
but they generall just extract resources anyway.

Each town has control over the units that it produces.  Each town has a certain amount of
units (HELP TOWNSIZE).  Once a unit is placed using placemob, it is placed in training
(HELP TRAINING).  Once it is done training, the unit will be placed at the barracks for
use.  The only excepion is the Worker Unit, the unit will be placed at the place where
you placed it using placemob.

You can equip units using the armmilitary command (HELP ARMMILITARY)

Lastly, there are 10 units per series.  If you have a townsize of 3, you can only purchase
the first 3 units.  The last unit also takes an extra 15 days to train, so the 3rd unit on
a size 3 town will take 15 days extra to train.

2 'UNKNOWN'~
#General~

Either you are confused or want to know about the unknown spell.  To be honest I
don't know if it is used or not, I just left it in for good measure.
~

2 UNLOADQAREA~
#General~
#END~
Syntax:  unloadqarea <area file name>

Used to unload a static quest area from the game.  In the selection
process for the perfect area, you might want to generated a few dozen
areas till you get what you want.  This will unload the area so you can
use the same filename/area name over and over.  

Notes:  Do not use on a static area that you have used foldqarea on.  It
will delete the area but after a copyover it will be back due to it does
not adjust the area.lst file.  Doing this could cause another area to get
saved over its spot causing unknown havok.

Notes: There is a bit of memory use here doing this (perhaps a memory leak?).
Was looking at 100k every 2-5 executions of this, so keep this in mind if you
are on a tight memory quota.  If you are not, well have fun.

2 UPDATESKILLS~
#Immortal ImmPlayers~
#END~
Syntax: updateskills <target>

Updateskills is used to set values on a player that reflect how he/she learns
other skills/spells in other spheres and groups.  It is important to use this
command on players after you do a sset (after they quit and relogin this problem
will be fixed too, but it is best to do this after a sset).

1 UPLIFT~
#Magic Cleric Assisting~

Syntax:  c uplift <target>
 
Uplift is a cleric spell that can heal from afar, meant to be used in 
aiding players with negative hitpoints.
Uplift is not to be used as your common mode of healing.  Repeatedly asking
for uplifts on public channels is spammy and annoying for other players.  
Keep in mind that the clerics that are uplifting you are doing so out of 
kindness.  Do _not_ abuse it or consider it a right.
~

1 USELICENSE~
#Kingdoms Creation~
#kingdoms Management~
#END~
syntax: uselicense <license>

A command to use a license that was granted to you or bought from the
caste mob.  As with grantlicense, check the command for the most current
license available for use.

mclass - Once you have this license, you can make a player owned 
shopkeeper. You will need to be in your kingdom town to use the license. 
If you get a fail message ask an immortal or try another room. 

maclass - Allows you to start a town.  You need to supply the name of
the town when you use the license.  For more information over creating
a town (HELP TOWN).
~

2 USEPROG~
#Immortal Building Progs~
#END~
Syntax: opedit <object> <command> [number] [use_prog] [percentage]
 
The use_prog is an objtrigger that can be used in object programs.  The
use_prog will be executed when the item is used.  To define what will
trigger the use_prog, here is a list:

* Wands - when you zap
* Staves - when you brandish
* Food/pills - when you eat
* Blood/fountains/drink containers - when you drink
* Lights/armour/weapons - when you wear/wield/hold
* Potions - when you quaff
* Pipes - when you smoke
 
When the use_prog is executed you will not see the standard 'use message'
(ie You quaff a violet potion). What you will will be any mpechoes placed
in the program.  Also, any mobprog commands can be used in use_prog (see 
MPCOMMANDS).

**NOTE** The use_progs on lights, armour, and weapons are executed BEFORE
the player wears/holds/wields any item. Therefore, a mpforce to remove the
item will not work in the use_prog.  You will have to use a wear trigger
to accomplish this.
~

2 USERS~
#Immortal System~
#END~
Syntax: users <host ip>
Syntax: users <playername>

USERS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including users
in the process of logging in.
If used with an argument, it will show all users from that host ip.
Shortforms of host will work -- e.x. 205, or 205.113, etc.
Shortened names will also work.  e.x., users fre would show
Fredrick and Fred if they were on at the time.
The first number, (desc), is the descriptor number that this user is on.
The second number is the user's connected state.  (See CONSTATES)
The third number is the number of seconds the user has been idle.
The fourth number is the remote TCP port on the user's host machine.
Next is the user's character name, then the user's host address.
(Usually the IP number as name resolving is normally disabled.)

The FORCECLOSE command can be used to force a connect to close by its
descriptor number.

5 VASSIGN~
#Immortal Building BuildingSetup~

syntax:  Vassign <player> <start vnum> <end vnum>

Used to assign an area for a builder to build with.  You should assign the
vnums in blocks of 50 (2100 - 2149, 2200 - 2399), etc.  This will make it work
better with other code, and keep it easy to figure out what is open.  This also

We need you to be real careful about the size of your watch file. If you
are watching a number of players or sites, please do not just forget about
your watches and allow your watch file to grow to outrageous sizes. You
should never have more than 5,000 or 10,000 lines in your watch file.
If you are doing some watching, be sure you check your watch file daily
and either print it, display it, copy it to your hard drive or do whatever
you need to do with it but then ... please ... please ... be sure you
clear it so that it don't grow huge and eat up all our hard drive space.
If you clear your watch file daily ... there should be no problem. If you
aren't watching anyone ... you don't have to worry about this. But if you
start a watch, it is your responsibility to know how big your watch file
is and to stop the watch when you no longer need it. The command
&G"watch size" &W tells you how many lines are in your watch file.
The command &G"watch clear"&W clears (deletes) your watch file.
For the time being the maximum number of lines you can display at one time
is 1000. So ... even if you have 5,000 lines in your watch file ... you can
only display 1,000 at a time.

Syntax:  wblock
Syntax:  wblock <players/kills/level>

Wblock is a 50 by 50 square in the wilderness.  In order for the wilderness to
load mobs of a certain "difficulty" the wblock system is used.  Each block is
loaded by the code (you cannot shift or create them) and then default values
are assigned the blocks.  Then the values you set for the blocks are loaded
from file.  You can use wblock command to mainly set the level (1-100) of
the wblock or use it to reset the kills count, or see what amount of players
have visited the block.

Level is used in the mobchart (help mobchart) to decide difficulty of the mob
and what equipment it will load.  AS you notice in mobchart, 25 will load
steel mobs (10 percent chance) and will load stats in the 25 range.  If you
don't know what this really means, consult Xerves before doing anything first!

the better it is at breaking, on the other hand, the larger the
weapon trying to be broken, the harder it is to break it.  Actually
breaking a weapon in one hit requires a lot of skill and a large
weapon, but if that does not happen, a lot of damage is applied
to the target weapon.  Knives and daggers beware!

~

1 WEAPONSIZEMORT~
#General~
#END~
First off, weaponsize and weight are two different things.  Weight of
a weapon does affect how well you can wield it, but it doesn't affect
your combat speed.  Weaponsize is a value given to a weapon based on
the actual size of a weapon and what race it is.  An Ogre Long Sword
is going to have more weaponsize than a Hobbit Long Sword.  Each race
has a certain section of weaponsize that they can wield.  If you are
at the bottom of that limit you will swing the weapon very very quickly.
If you are at the top of that limit you will swing the weapon much
slower.

It is important to take this into consideration.  Sometimes using a weapon
that wasn't meant for your race can come in handy due to weaponsize.

2 WEAPONSYS~
#Immortal Building BuildingObjs~
#END~
The weaponsystem really hasn't changed that much in 2.0.  You have the
weaponsizes (HELP WEAPONSIZE).  Mainly, the heavier the weapon, the more
time it is going to take to attack (half a second per one).  This time can
be improved by wearing lighter armor, spells, and agility.

Each race also gets a increase/decrease modifier on gaining agility.  It goes
as follows.

Fairy    140%
Hobbit   120%
Elf      105%
Human    100%

1 WEATHERINFO~
#General~
#END~
Our weather system is unique in the realm of mudding because it is not 
based off what most new weather systems are, the Medevia Weather System. 
Our system is based off of moving weather systems called currents. These 
currents move a certain direction (cold fronts move se and warm fronts move 
sw, cold fronts start nw and warm fronts ne) and bring along them change in 
weather, precipitation, and winds. As the weather changes, so does the 
precipitation, it comes in the way of either rain, snow, or ice. Of course 
each is based off of the temperature of the area, so you will only be 
seeing snow in the colder areas of the weather, not in the middle of 
summer. Also, the temperature is warmest at the center of the world, and 
grows colder as it branches out to the north and south side. 

In addition to precipitation, when two fronts hit eachother, there is a 
chance that a Tornado will occur (there is also a temperature variable). 
Tornados are very dangerous, in particular in the Caste map because it can 
disrupt sectors and throw your loyal followers away from their location. 
However, in the game map, it will only throw individuals who get close 
enough to the Tornado. 

That is mainly it, the system offers the basic weather design, and will be 
a lot more valuable later on when new skills/spells are offered that are 
more weather designed and use the power of the weather to reak havoc. 

Lastly, it is important to be properly equiped when going outside of the 
cities. If it is really cold, if you are not properly equiped, you will 
suffer damage, and if you stay out too long, you will die. In the warm 
weather, if you are not wearing shoes, you will also suffer damage, so be 
equiped (this is primarily for Wilderness, and some areas). In addition, if 
you think the 15 second update on the weather is too spammy, you can change 
it by turning on the noweather config option in CONFIG. Also, you can add 
similar values to your prompt with %w and %W (help wprompt for more info). 
~

1 WEB SNARE STEPBACK~
#General~
#END~
Syntax:  c 'web' [target]
Syntax:  c 'snare' [target]
Syntax:  stepback

A very powerful spell added to the Wizardry sphere that allows mages to
stop an opponents in their tracks.  Once the target is stopped you can
either continue fighting or use the stepback command to get out of combat.
If all mobs you are fighting are webbed combat will end and you will have
a chance to either flee or continue combat in another manner.  If you wish
to use magic or projectiles you have a good chance of landing an attack and
not getting attacked back.

When an enemy is webbed that enemy cannot attack back if you have stepped out
of battle (note, you have to step out of battle or it will keep pounding on
you).  Once out of battle every 4 seconds there is a chance the creature will
break the web (based on strength and intelligence).  Also, the web can be broken
if damage is done to the enemy.  If it is in the form of magic or a projectile the
changes are greater.  If a fire spell is used the chance is the greatest.

As for snare, it is the same as web but the duration is longer, the chance of
landing is better, and breaking it is much more difficult.  The only downside is
it is a Tier 4 spell so only those who wish to stay dominantly wizard will ever
get to use it.

Lastly, stepback can be used if the target is stunned (either through a stun or
if their hp is < 0).  Anytime you choose to run away instead of fight and the
mob is aggressive, it will give chase after the web is broken.  However, web has
a longer life than a stun so you might be long gone before the poor thing even
has a chance.

1 WEIGHT~

The weight of a weapon affects how well you can wield it.  Depending on
your strength, you can wield a weapon without any reduction in speed
besides the normal weaponsize reductions.  However, if you go over your
max weight, you will see this message in Red.

Wielding such a heavy weapon is going to slow you down!!

This means you have gone over your max allowed weight.  For every 3 you
go over, it will take 1 second longer in combat.  The max combat lag is
12 seconds.

The above is an example of what the Rafermand Wilderness map looks like.
As you see, it is very colorful and doesn't use any text to explain the
location.  It might later have a description to the east of the block
of ASCII characters.  As with any map, each little character and its color
means it represents a sector (terrain) type and each type required a certain
amount of movement and sometimes needs a fly or float spell to pass.

That is the general look of the map, the size is deterimed by the time of
day, if you have a light, and the use of the wizardeye spell.

In addition, while traveling the wilderness, you have to be careful to be
prepared to defend yourself against wondering pests, thieves, monsters, and
much more because in the wilderness mobs are loaded every once and awhile and
they start to come after you and your party.  You are a lot safer if you are
traveling in numbers, or have guards and/or escorts from your kingdom.

There are a few other things to do with the wilderness, you should read the
helpfiles below.

Wilderness code was orginally provided by Samson and modified quite a bit to
get out the bugs and add new features.

2 WIZINVIS~
#Immortal System~
#END~
All immortals have the responsibility to be available to others whenever
possible, be they mortal or immortal.  When the use of wizinvis is called
for, the following are parameters for its use:
 
 - Immortals level 51 through 54 should be visible at all times, save
   for when snooping, running a quest or some similar circumstance.
 
 - Immortals level 55 and up may invis to any level at their discretion.
 
Guidelines for use of wizinvis by 55 and higher:
It is considered mandatory to be visible to all other immortals whenever
reasonably able to do so.  Using wizinvis beyond 51 to facilitate work on
a project, allow concentration on something, avoid excessive tells or the
like is fine, but it should only be used while necessary.
 
Guidelines for use of wizinvis beyond 51 in immortal channels:
Sightings of Someones in immortal channels should be kept to a minimum.
If you are free enough to be able to use an immortal channel, you should
be visible to the lowest immortal in that channel; no higher than 54 in
Muse, no higher than 51 in immtalk, etc.  Being a Someone to anyone on
an immortal channel should only occur if you're too tied up to go
visible but need to make a comment.
 
The same applies to all situations using channels, tells or actions.
Avoid being a Someone to mortals and immortals alike unless you have
a good reason to do otherwise.

A worker unit is used to extract resources from the game.  A worker unit can be placed
at two locations: in your AOC or at a storage bin.  If placed in your AOC, the worker
will go out and look for resources to extract and then dump the resources back into
your town.  If using a storage bin, the unit will dump into the storage bin and then
your kingdom will need to haul the bin back.  It is much more efficient to have the
unit dump back into your town, so think about that when placing a town and planting
resources around you for extraction.

Lastly, a Worker can extract any resource, but only 1 at a time.  When you place the
mob, you tell it what resource to extract.  Once it runs out of resources to extract,
the unit will cease extracting and you won't have to pay it anymore.  Otherwise, it
will keep going and keep charging (by the RL hour).  You can get rid of a unit by
using the dismissunit command or killing it.
