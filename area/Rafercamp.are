Blacksmith~
Blacksmith~
The Blacksmith sits near the back with his hammer hammering away
~
The blacksmith at first glanace is a rough looking human.  It appears
he has been growing a beard as long as he has been alive because it
is almost near the ground.  His skin is rather dark from being around
the ash and fire, and he is built enough to do his job.

Exit into the World of Rafermand~
Just to the south, a small road leads right out into the rest of the
world.  However, just before the exit there is a small sign that reads
as follows......"It is a very dangerous world out their young adventurers,
if you plan on traveling far, it is advised to have trained in some skills
and have picked up equipment before leaving".

Rolen Road is the main road that runs through this short camp.  It

Weapon Shop~
All around the walls, various weapons line the walls.  Ranging from
daggers, crossbows, swords, axes, to even clubs, all the weapons that
a beginning traveler might want, is available at this location.  Because
all the weapons available here are already forged, they come at a decent
price tag.

Ore Shop~
Various amounts of ore are held securely in transparent chests that just
lie on the ground.  A small elf in the background of the store appears to
be selling the ore, but from a close look around, you can tell that this
store just sells the ore because there is not a facility to produce the
various weapons/armor that is available when forged with ore.

Rolen Road~
To the west, the huge massive area that 
is the forge stretches far into the 
horizon. The forge is the center of the 
camp because it is where adventurers go 
to craft new equipment. However, 
because of thie size of the open area 
in the forge, only __ONE__ person can 
go into the forge at at time. To the 
east, a small leather shop is available 
selling leather products to the public.

Thrift Shop~
The shop is littered with rather inexperience items of all sorts.  Most
of the material being sold is something like a shirt or organic material
that can be worn or used.  Some of the items available here might be
useful, but the question is, to whom?

Road to Practice Field~
Just to the west, a small 4 by 4 area exists for the sole purpose of
sparring with the creatures that are in the area and sparring with other
players.  It is the only area in Rafermand that is non-pkill, so anyone
that wants to spar is safe in this area.

Road to Practice Field~
Just a few more steps to the west, there is a practice field that can
be used to spar and practice you skills.  A few words before you step
in though.  Even though the area is non-pkill, it is not to be used
as an area to hide away from people who are trying to chase you down.
The immortals frown upon such actions and might actually force you
out.

it out in hope of training their skills and becoming more able to handle
their own against their peers and the outside world.  Just remember, you

brand new Rolen School, where one would 
be taught to the ways of Rafermand. To 
the east lays the trainer road, where 
trainers teach skills entrace to the

Academy Road~
Just to the east, you can see the Entrance of the Academy.  The Academy
is a good place to start out if you are new to Rafermand.  There you can
learn about the new systems in Rafermand, about the game, and find some
trainers to help you start learning some skills and spells.  To the west,
you can see the area that is known as the Practice Field.  It is the place
that is safe to spar with mobs and players.

The Academy~
North and South of you, there are various rooms with information over
the different systems of Rafermand, along with information over them.
It might be a good idea to check them out, even if you are a veteran
to Mudding because Rafermand is very different from the typical 2000
or so muds out there.  In addition, you can find some trainers to help
you start learning new skills/spells (along with some help over trainers).
To the west, the exit out of the camp and the Practice Field.

Level System~
Rafermand features a No Level system.  That is right, you do not obtain
levels.  Instead of gaining stats by leveling as you normally do, you gain
them through other ways.  You gain hp by fighting (not sparring) and taking
damage, you gain mana by using magic (again not sparring), you can also
increase your stats (str, int, etc) by various other ways that are linked
to each stat (exect wisdom, which is gained through age).  You can increase these
stats by sparring, just not as quickly.

Kingdom System~
The Kingdom System is the meat of Rafermand.  The Kingdom system allows
players to take full control over an area (even where to create it) and
build up its population by providing food and services for the population.
In tern, you can place merchants, personal areas, and much more in the
kingdom.  You can also purchase mobs to be used in military action, plow
corn, and much more.  Again (HELP KINGDOMS) for more info because it is
a very vast system.

the whole game together.  It is also a growing creature that responds to
player commands and density.  You can change the amount of mobiles and
difficulty by visiting or not visiting an area.  Still much is not known
at this time about the Wilderness.

Weapon/Armor System~
If there is one thing you need to know is, ALWAYS WEAR NECK AND HEAD
GEAR.  There are 5 targetable limbs when you are fighting (head, neck,
arms, legs, and chest).  A landed blow to the neck is instant death and
most shots to the head are the same.  You can also chop off either the
right or left hand/leg.  This will affect different things in battle.
It is always important to be wearing armor to help keep damage to a
minimum.  For more info type (HELP FIGHTING)

Class System~
Rafermand features a no Class System.  You might of noticed at the
beginning of character selection you did not choose a class, and that
is the reason why.  You do not "pick" a class later, so it is truely
a classless system.  You are free to choose any spell/skill you want,
but there are limits on that.  For more infomation over skills, check
out the skill/spell room.

Battle System~
We offer a realtime Battle System.  This means that the battle keeps
going on if you don't input a command.  After so many ticks, you are
able to input another attack or defensive move.  Each command you use
in battle (like attack, c 'heal', roundhouse) will take so many turns
up, and till those turns pass over, you cannot use another attack.
You can also target limbs, but that is in the weapon/armor section.

Pkill System/Rules~
Rafermand is full Pkill full Loot everywhere except in the Training
Grounds (which is toward the west).  Newbies that enter into Rafermand
will have a 5 hour protection for pkilling, after that, you will be
fair game to anyone who wants to attack.  Most players are not aggressive
and will not attack you for a reason, while others might.  If you feel
you are being targeted unfairly, complain to the mortals who are
responsible for policing this, not the immortals.

Role Playing Rules~
Rafermand is a RP oriented Mud.  It might be a good idea to visit this
link.
   www.rafermand.com/rpinfo.htm

It contains a lot of rp backgrounds regarding anything you might ever
want to know.  A lot of the players will know this history and will
react to it accordingly.  In addition, you might have noticed a few
Elves roaming around, this is because we have an introduction system.
This makes it so you don't know another player's name unless he/she
introduces him/herself

Forge System~
Most of the equipment in Rafermand comes by the way of Forging.  In
this camp (area) there is a forge.  The forge can take ore (which you
can find, buy, earn) and make slabs out of it.  Then you can take these
slabs and craft pieces of armor and weapons out of the slabs.  The
more powerful the ore, the more powerful the weapon/armor.  For more
information over the Forge System, type (HELP FORGE)

Death System~
The Death system is slightly different here.  Every time you die here
you will leave a corpse with your equipment on it at the point you died.
Your corpse is fullloot at this point.  In addition, you will experience
something called stat drain.  Stat drain is temporary and will regain your
full stats in about 10 minutes unless someone casts a revival spell on your
corpse at its location.  If you happen to die again before you stat drain
is finished, you will lose those stats.

Welcome to Rafermand: Tides of Change!~
&CHello and welcome to Rafermand: Tides of Change.  You will quickly go through a
few rooms that will explain some simple rules and tell you a little bit about
the game.  If you are not somewhat familiar with this game, here are a few
tidbits of information.

Tides of Change (which will often be called ToC) is built on the Rafermand world
that is running on another port.  The games share the world, but the system in
which the games run are totally different.  ToC is a full pkill, full loot game
that focuses more on kingdom warfare and personal pkilling than on item collect
and stat building.  It is still important to collect items and build stats here
since you will need those to survive (it is also easier here), but the real focus
is on trying to win the game through kingdom play.  

Once someone has won the game, the immortals will announce a game reset and everything
in the game will be completely reset to a new state.  You will be able to reload
old characters, but you will not get to keep your stats and equipment.


If this sounds like your cup of tee, simply type this &w&R(say play)&w&C and you will moved
to the next room.  If this does not sound like your game, try Rafermand at
mud.rafermand.net port 3002

Basic rules~
&CRules are still being worked on at this moment.  The game play is going to
be geared toward using the least amount of rules posible and to encourage players
to work together instead of complaining about how things are going.  Most of the
rules that most games have, camping and kill stealing, will not apply here due to
the nature of gameplay.  It is quite possible for you to become annoyed by certain
tactics of players, but just remember that things reset and everyone starts out
fresh next time, so remember that you will eventually get your own if you are
a bastard to others.

With that in mind, here are a few rules to follow.

* This is a pkill mud, but will will not take kindly to intense harassment of other
  players in the game.  We encourage you to have fun and enjoy your victories, but
  don't rub it in too much.
* Ignorange of the laws is not an excuse.  If you think you might be breaking one, ask.
* Please report bugs at the time of discovery.  Abusing bugs to a point of gaining a
  huge advantage over other players could lead to a pfile deletion.
* There will be no Multiplaying for the time being.  Check the boards for any changes
  to this rule.
* There are no rules involved with looting or camping of any kind.  These practices are
  allowed and are part of the tactical side of this game.  If you don't like what someone
  is doing, I would suggest working with others to stop him/her.
* Password = ownership.  
* Try to keep public channels somewhat clean.  If you are asked to tone down your language
  by an immortal you need to respect his/her request.
* We do not do CRs.  Since corpses are lootable by anyone, you can ask for help from players
  that you trust.
* Twink points (for killing someone weaker than you) is negotiable for a reduction.  You
  need to explain the situation.  Having the backing of the one you killed will help with
  this process.
* Respect the wishes of the immortals.  The staff here is very laid back and are often freely
  available to talk with if you are having problems.  This mud is not about punishing people,
  but allow people to have fun a play.

If you agree to play by these rules and any others added later, please type the following to
be transported to the name approval room: &w&R(say agree)&w&C

Name approval room~
&w&CSoon you will transferred into the game.  If an immortal is online he/she
will either deny or allow your name.  Some players have this ability too and
will do it if there are no immortals online.  You can be asked to change either
your first or last name.  We encourage you to read the helpfile over your race
if you are new to Rafermand.  To do this simply type &w&R(help race name)&w&C to get
some useful information over what to do with your race.  If you wish to perhaps
pick another race, simply type &w&R(quit)&w&C to leave the game.  Your name will
not be saved so you will be free to use it with another character if you wish.

Once you are ready to play, pull the sword (type: &RPULL SWORD&C).

If your name is deemed suitable for play, the immortals will authorize you,
and you will be transferred into to the game.

If your name is refused, you will have to pick another by using the name 
command: &RNAME <new name>&C.

In the case that no one is on that can authorize you, the wait should only be
about a minute or so.

You might be asked later on to change your name.

&w&CThis large circular room is the center of the school
Large groups of students walk by carrying books and
conversing quietly.  From this room you can access all
parts of the school as well as go south to Rolen camp.
Two parts of the school are to the east and the west.

It is vital that you read &w&RHELP NEWBIETIPS&w&C whether you
go through the faculties or not - even an old dweller 
will find important tips there. 

If you type &w&Rhelp map&w&C, you are located at the Newbie School.

Entrance to the Faculty of Basic Studies~
Hopefully this will be done soon.  If you are a complete newbie I really
suggest just heading west and reading.  You can use the &w&Wlook&w&C command
to view a room if you need to see it again.  You should already know the &w&Wwest
and east&w&C command.  You can use n, w, s, e, se, ne, nw, sw to move in any
direction that is listed.  Good luck, if you need help simply use the newbie
channel &w&W(type:  newbie <message>)&w&C to ask your question.  Anytime you see
a < > around something, that is just to tell you that you need to type some sort
of message there, just make sure not to include the < > in the message.

Entrance to the Faculty of Rafermand Specialization~
Welcome!
You must wonder what makes Rafermand such a great place?
Well, in those next rooms, you will get a glimpse of the answer.
You'll learn all about the special features of Rafermand.

Please take the time and read all the information, including
the many help files which are mentioned in those rooms.

You are free to come back to these rooms whenever you want.

The first lesson will explain the level system of Rafermand
(or rather, the lack of it).

Go South when you wish to start.

Level System~
Rafermand features a No Level system.  That is right, you do not obtain
levels.  Instead of gaining stats by leveling as you normally do, you gain
them through other ways.  You gain hp by fighting (not sparring) and taking
damage, you gain mana by using magic (again not sparring), you can also
increase your stats (str, int, etc) by various other ways that are linked
to each stat (except wisdom, which is gained through age).  You can increase these
stats by sparring, just not as quickly.

A good rule to remember is: progression depends on usage, be that stats, skills 
or spells.

To get started, you might want to read the following help files:
&RHELP LEVELS&C, &RHELP STATS&C, &RHELP GSCORE&C, &RHELP SPARRING&C.

&CNote: Sparring code is still being worked on, and is currently disabled.

Next we will discuess the Class System, go east when you are ready.

Class System~
Very much like levels, Rafermand simply does not have a Class System.  
You might have noticed at the beginning of character creation you did not 
choose a class, and that is the reason why.  
You do not "pick" a class later, so it is truely a classless system.  

To make up for the lack of a class system we feature a complex skills and
spells system, which will be discussed deeply in the next rooms.

If you havent done so already, read &RHELP CLASS&C (the same as &RHELP &RLEVELS&C).

Next we will cover the Skill System, go south when you are ready.

Skills and Spells System, Lesson 1~
The Skills and Spells System is the main measure of character advancement, and as such
its very complex and takes some time to get used to.

Skills and spells are basically the same, the main difference is that skills normally
have unique commands, while all spells are used by casting them (&RCAST <SPELL NAME>&C).
The skills and the spells coexist in a hierarchical structure: First they are divided 
into spheres, when each sphere is divided into groups.
It is important to know which sphere or group the skills and spells you learn are in,
because eventually, you can only have so many spheres and groups (more about it later).
Some skills are solo, which means that they are not associated to any sphere or group.

The best way to learn about the skill and spell system is by reading the following
help files: &RHELP SKILLS&C, &RHELP TIERS&C, &RHELP MASTERY&C, &RHELP SPHERES&C, &RHELP MAGIC&C, &RHELP ELEMENTS&C.
Most of these helpfiles are just starting points to more in depth helpfiles, so be
sure to read them all, they contain valuable information, and gives a good insight
on how this system work.

After you familiarize yourself with the system, you should get to know the existing
spells and skills, in order for you to choose those skills and spells you wish to learn.

The command to show all or some of them is &RLISTGROUPS&C, you will be using it a lot,
so you might want to start off by reading &R&RHELP LISTGROUPS&C&C.
To view all the spheres and groups along with the solo skills type &R&RLISTGROUPS &RALLGROUPS&C&C.
To view a specific group type &RLISTGROUPS <GROUP NAME>&C, in this list the skills and
spells are color coded, the color represent the tier of the skill or spell. 
To see when you can advance in mastery (and then be able to learn more advanced tier
skills and spells) use &RLISTGROUPS TOADVANCE&C.

Now will be a good time to read all the relevant helpfiles of the various skills and
spells (&RHELP <SKILL OR SPELL NAME>&C), when you are done, go west to learn a true skill.

Skills and Spells System, Lesson 2~
Learning or advancing in a skill is comprised of a few steps:
&CFirst, decide which skill you wish to learn or advance in.
&CSecond, make sure you can learn or advance in that skill.
&CThird, find the trainer who can teach you.
&CFourth, learn the new skill or advance in the skill.

&CTo better explain this, we will use the friendly trainer Rossi, you might notice
&Cthat before his name there is a &W[TRAINER]&C tag, which means he can teach.

And how do you go about that? Well, by using the &RLEARN&C command, and again, please
&Ctake the time and read &RHELP LEARN&C.

You probably know by now (because you read the helpfile) that you can get a list
&Cof available skills for a trainer, to do so type &RLEARN ROSSI&C.

&CThe only skill that Rossi can teach is the standard style skill, which belongs to 
&Cthe styles group (if you paid attention, you should know by now that the listgroups
&Ccommand is used to find out such information, just type &RLISTGROUPS 'STANDARD STYLE'&C)

We advise you to learn this skill, do so by typing:
&RLEARN ROSSI 'STANDARD STYLE' BEGINNER&C.
Next time you fight, make sure to use your new skill, have you read the help file
you should know that this is done by typing &RSTYLE STANDARD&C.

After you learn the skill, move on south to the next lesson on this system.

Skills and Spells System, Lesson 3~
There is a small addition, when it comes to learning new spells.
To learn a new spell you will need a spell book, those books are available
throughout Rafermand, mostly in shops.
These shops have a special command to handle spell books: sbook.
As usual read &RHELP SBOOK&C to learn all about this command, that is used
to list and buy books.

Lets learn how to cast the useful spell Create Food (guess what it does...).
First buy the relevant spell book, just type &RSBOOK BUY CREATE FOOD&C.
After you get the book, learn the spell as you would any skill, type
&RLEARN KORTIN 'CREATE FOOD' BEGINNER&C.

Now that you got the spell, next time you are hungry, you can cast it by typing
&RCAST 'CREATE FOOD'&C, then pick up the mushroom and eat it.

This lesson concludes the commands of this system, move on east to read some
important notes that will complete those lessons.

Skills and Spells System, Final Notes~
There is a lot of information regarding the skills and spells system, but some things
are important to know, so these notes might seem redundant:

* If you did not understand that yet, the most basic rule is that you get better at
  things you do, that rule applies to everything from stats to skills.
  This rule is true the other way around also, if you stop using a skill or spell, in
  time you will lose it.

* You can monitor your improvement using two commands:
  &RGSCORE&C command for stats, and the &RSKILLS&C command for skills and spells.
  Your progress shows in the star bar, which shows every stat, skill and spell you have.
  When the bar fills white, you improve.
  Improvment can mean more hp, more strength or a more powerful skill (skill power is
  measured in skill points, more skill points you have, the more powerful the skill).
  Also note that the bar can go down, and when it goes all red, you lose points.

* Skills and spells work in spheres, the more total skill points you have in a sphere
  the easier it becomes to advance in that sphere and less in other spheres. 
  The more spread out, the harder.
  You can still learn new skills and spells from new spheres, but it will gradually
  get harder until it will be impossible to improve.
  Another important note is that when you improve in a sphere, it can counter affect
  other spheres (losing skill points).

* The element you choose when you created your character is the only magic sphere you 
  will be able to get to the Master mastery, the Expert mastery is the highest mastery 
  you can learn for the other spheres.

Go south to learn about our Kingdom System.

Kingdom System~
The Kingdom System is the meat of Rafermand.
This vast autonomous system is ran completely by the players.
Each kingdom is ruled by a King, who is a player, each kingdom can have many towns,
and each town have a mayor and its own population (special mobs).

Anyone can become a King, and as such you have almost absolute power over your subjects.
You can let other people join your kingdom, assign them to jobs, and together 
build your towns (and you can also kick them out, if you don't like them).

You have full control over an area, you need to tend to the population,
supply them with food to let them grow, and gradually expand your town.
You select where your kingdom and towns will be built, and you design and build 
them the way you see fit.

You will need to make sure you have enough raw materials (Iron, Wood etc) that are
used to build, and can be bought or harvested throughout the world.

You can acquire mobs, such as trainers, bankers, shopkeepers, and even some special mobs
such as harvesting mobs and military mobs.
Harvesting mobs are used to plow and harvest automatically.
Military mobs can be equipped and sent to conquer opposing kingdoms, or stand guard and
defend your kingdom from rival players and kingdoms.
You can sign peace treaties and declare war on any kingdom, or you can remain neutral.

This is just a short introduction for a vast and important part of Rafermand, 
there are many help files to guide you through all the aspects of kingdoms.

We recommend reading all the following help files to get started:
&RHELP KINGDOMS&C, &RHELP KINGDOM COMMANDS&C, &RHELP JOBS&C, &RHELP BUILD&C.
Many of those helpfiles have a reference to other helpfiles, you should
read those also.

When you are done, continue on to the west to read about the Wilderness System.

Wilderness System Overview~
We feature a lot of ASCII maps here, in zones (like this room) and also the
wilderness outside. The wilderness is a huge ASCII map that is used to connect
the whole game together.  It is also a growing creature that responds to
player commands and density.  You can change the amount of mobs and
difficulty by visiting (or not) an area.  Still much is not known
at this time about the Wilderness. As usual read &RHELP WILDERNESS&C.

Wilderness System Commands~
Getting around in the wilderness could be a long tedious journey.
It's a great way to increase your endurance, but most people use a mount to move
around.
Mounts are special mobs designed to carry one around the world (out in the
wilderness and inside zones and cities) and just like players, they can also gain 
endurance, you can also buy special food to feed your mount and restore his endurance
(read &RHELP MOUNT FOOD&C), you can read much more about mounts in &RHELP MOUNTS&C.

You might have noticed in the previous room that the view is somewhat limited.
The number of squares you can see is affected by your held light and time of day.
There are two things to be done regarding that, the first thing is to use the
command &RLOOKAROUND&C to see a slightly bigger map (see &RHELP LOOKAROUND&C).
The other thing is a spell called &RWIZARDEYE&C, which will improve his caster's
view of the world (see &RHELP WIZARDEYE&C).

Move on to the east to the next lesson.

Death System~
The Death system is slightly different here.  
Every time you die here you will leave a corpse with your equipment on 
it at the point you died.
Your corpse is full-loot at this point (meaning everyone can take anything
from it).  
Your corpse will rot (meaning it will disappear and anything in it lost) after
about 30 real time minutes

This is a brief explanation, more help could be found at &RHELP DEATH&C.

Next you get to forge your very own weapon, go south when you are ready.

Combat System, First Lesson: Introduction~
Finally we get to learn all about how the action is done in Rafermand.
Coming in line with some of the systems introduced here, the combat system
is completly unique, and if you have played some muds before, could take some
time to get used to.

The basic idea behind our combat system is to make it as realistic as possible
within the boundaries of a text mud.

The first thing you will notice about the combat system is that it is limb based.
What is limb based you ask? Well, this simply means that contrary to other
combat systems that manage damage and armor for the whole character, here its done
on a limb base.
Every limb has its own protective armor, and thus its own protective value (you
may regard it as Armor Class per limb), derived from the fact that not wearing 
protective armor at all may result in your immediate death in one blow.

To add an even more realistic twist, there are 3 kinds of armor modifiers, for
3 types of attacks: Bash, Slash and Stab.
And as you might understand, each piece of armor has 3 armor modifiers (also
called mods) values, one for each attack type.

The introduction continues to the south.

Combat System, Second Lesson: Introduction cont.~
Weapons as you might guess, also have 3 modifiers, which dictate how much damage
the weapon does in each attack type.
What it  all comes down to is that when you fight, you choose your grip
(Bash, Slash or Stab) and the target limb you wish to damage.
According to the weapons attack mod, and the target limb armor mod, the damage is
calculated.

Another important thing to know about the combat system is that the attacks are done
in semi-realtime way.
You hit as fast as your agility allows, and the size of your weapon greatly affects
the time you will have to wait until you can try to hit again.

Once in a while you might have a lucky hit, those hits are called critical strikes,
and they can result in your enemy losing a limb or even death.

Note that mobs that are intelligent will aim for your weak spots, so it is extremely
crucial to wear protective armor on your neck, head and chest, which are the most
vulnerable limbs (a successful clear neck shot will kill you).

The next room to the east translates all this into commands.

Forge System~
Our forge system is the source of most of the equipment in Rafermand.
The idea behind the forge system is simple, there are 19 ore types and around
80 weapon and armor types in the game.
A player can simply create any weapon or armor with any ore type.
As usual, read &RHELP FORGE&C to know all about it.

Its also really easy to do, the first thing you need to do is get some ore or slabs
(slabs are processed ores), and using the slabs you can create any piece.

You do not need any special skill, but you do have to find a forge room.
A forge room is a special room where you can forge, and only one person may be in
a forge at any time.
There is such a room down, but before you go there, you should buy enough copper ores
to make a short sword, the amount of ore is determined by your race, the bigger you are
the more ore it will take to make armor or weapons.
To see how many slabs it will take to make a short sword type: &RFORGE LIST SWORD&C
(a more complete overview of the forge command will be in the forge room).
Buy the appropriate amount of ore from Yeshud the ore trader, you will also need 
charcoals in order to make slabs, one charcoal for each ore (type &RLIST&C to get a 
list of the things he sells, then &RBUY <ITEM>&C to buy it).

You will use the ore to make slabs, and then use the slabs to make a short sword.
Note that forged armor have a race restriction, meaning, only someone from your race will
be able to wear armor you forge.

Type &RDOWN&C to get to the forge room, but since only one person can reside there at
any moment, it might be occupied.

Now that you have your new sword, you probably want to know how to use it, go west
to learn the first lesson on the combat system.

School Forge~
As mentioned before, creating new weapon and armor pieces is easy.
You will only need the &RFORGE&C command to do it.

First step is to make slabs, if you bought copper ore and charcoal, you can just
use the &RFORGE SLAB <ORE NUMBER>&C command to do so.
Using the &RFORGE ORES&C you can find out the appropriate ore number of copper
(which is 1, since its the most basic ore).
Go ahead and create slabs, notice that the slab is placed on the floor and 
needs to cool down, only once it cools down you can then pick it up.
Note that there is a chance of the breaking process to fail, and then you will not
get any slabs, but will lose the ore.

When you have enough copper slabs, its time to forge a short sword.
&RFORGE CREATE <ORE NUMER> <ITEM>&C is used to do that.

Other useful forge command options is sell, appraise and sell.
&RFORGE SELL <ORE NUMBER>&C is used to sell slabs.
&RFORGE APPRAISE <ITEM NAME>&C will tell you how many slabs you will get by breaking 
a weapon or armor.
&RFORGE BREAK <ITEM NAME>&C is used to salvage slabs from an item - very useful when
you loot various items from mobs.

To create a short sword type: &RFORGE CREATE 1 8&C, simple, no?
Let it cool off and then you can pick it up and wield it (&RGET SWORD&C, &RWEAR SWORD&C)

When you have your weapon ready, go back up.

Combat System, Third Lesson: Basic Commands~
The main command that is used in our combat system is the &RTARGET&C command.
Using it, you can define which limb and grip you wish to use, and when you
engage in combat (by using the &RATTACK <TARGET>&C command), you will 
auto-attack using those settings.
You can also turn off auto-attack using &RTARGET OFF&C.

If you wish to fight manually, you can use the &RATTACK&C and &RGRIP&C commands to
fight, but then you will have to type &RATTACK <TARGET> <LIMB>&C each time you
wish to make damage.
The &RGRIP <BASH/SLASH/STAB>&C command is used to determine your grip, and you can
change it in the middle of combat.

If you are wielding a short sword, that you made in the forge, you might want to
type in &RATTACK SLASH&C since swords are a generally good slashing weapon.
If you have a different weapon, you should pick a grip that best suits your weapon,
since there is no real use of using a dagger with a bash grip, or a hammer with a stab
grip.

This is the last lesson of this faculty.
Now you should venture and explore the wonderful world of Rafermand.
The final helpfile we strongly recommend to read is &RHELP ADVICE&C, this helpfile 
contains some necessary steps to start off your adventures.

**NOTE:  Going south will bring you back to the entrance of the Faculty of Rafermand

School Armorer~
Most of this room is crowded with large baskets that holds various armors 
and weapons. No visiable order can be discerned, but the agile armorer 
seems to know exactly where is everything. The entrance is practically 
blocked by long desk, preventing from unauthorized people from approching 
the overloaded crates. A small sign states that who ever needs equipments, 
just needs to say &ROUTFIT&C.

Path to the Battle Grounds~
A small path cuts northwest that leads directly into the battle grounds.
The battle grounds are used by those new to Rafermand to start to hone
their battle skills.  There are 4 tiers or sets of enemies to fight.  The
first set is the easiest and they get harder as you progress.  To the
east, the welcoming land of Rolen Camp and the Academy entrance awaits.

Path to the Battle Grounds~
The path continues on to the Battle Grounds.  In order to advance in
the Battle Grounds, you need to learn the password to advance to the
next tier of the Battle Grounds.  There is one enemy in each tier that
will tell you the password upon defeat (that mob is typically the most
difficult).  This keeps newbies from traveling on before they are ready
for the next tier.

the road, numerous cages holding wild beasts is open to all who wish
to test their battle skills.  In order to advance to Tier 2, you need
to defeat the beast caged in the right cage closest to the Tier 2
entrance.  You can see and hear the bloody thing from here.

Cage~
A few chains and locks litter what is mostly a cage used to hold wild
beasts.  A few beasts are shackled to their changes and are seperated
for your attacking pleasure.  Remember, if it begins to become too much,
you can always flee.  In addition, it is not wise to attack more than

Cage~
A few chains and locks litter what is mostly a cage used to hold wild
beasts.  A few beasts are shackled to their changes and are seperated
for your attacking pleasure.  Remember, if it begins to become too much,
you can always flee.  In addition, it is not wise to attack more than
one target at a time unless you are sure you can take them all.

Between Cages~
The path continues north and south.  To the east and west, there
are cages that are being used to hold the creatures captured for
your thwacking enjoyment.  Do not be afraid to enter the cages
because the creatures are held down by chains and cannot attack
you or assist one another.

Right before the Door to Tier 2~
To the north, you can see the door that leads into Tier 2 of the Battle
Grounds.  A small cage like the rest of the cages is to the west, but
a giant cage is just to the east, and from here you can see this hidious
beast snarling and jumping against the cage.  You can see a few bones
scattered around the cage too, so you might be careful going in there
and be ready for battle at all times.

A Giant Cage~
Unlike the rest of the cages, there is only one set of locks and chains
and it is used to hold this huge beast.  Where as the other detainees
aren't all that nasty looking, this one is snarling and trying to get
free.  Good thing that those shackles are holding it down, or it just
might get free and cause some problems for some unknowing individuals.
In order to move on to Tier 2, you need to defeat this beast.

Entrance to Tier2 of the Battle Grounds~
The door to Tier2 of the Battle Grounds is right here before you.  In
order to advance to Tier2, you need to know the password to move on.
You can get it be defeating the mob in the cage just to the south and
east of here.  If you know it, say it, and the guard will open the doors
for you.  If not, go back and destroy the beast.

Exit to Tier1 of the Battle Grounds~

A guard is here standing his post and will let you back in if you utter
the words used to get here in the first place.  To the north, you can
see what appears to be the next Tier of the Battle Grounds

All around you, all you can see is just open fields and figures moving back
and forth in between them.  This Tier offers slightly more difficult enemies
to fight, but they still will not attack you or assist eachother in this Tier.
It is also up to you to find the mobile that is holding the key to the next
Tier.

or an adventurer halling tail back to the entrance.  To the north, the door
toward Tier3 is clearly in sight, but why would you want to leave this fun?

Battle Fields~
It seems there is a bit less racket up toward the northern part of the fields.
Perhaps it is because most of the combat going on is toward the south, or
people are just moving toward the door to the north.  However, ths grass is
still bloodied up here, so don't think you are in the clear just yet.

Entrance into Tier 3~
A guard is here guarding the door and opening it for those who know the
password to the next area.  All you need to do is say the password to move
on.  If you don't know the password, just move back into the field and
try to find it (hint read the descriptions in the rooms)

Down in a Hole~
You climb down the hatch and land in what appears to be a small hobbit
hole.  It appears to be fully furnished and appears that someone is living
in here.  Perhaps you should leave this place right now, or perhaps you
should start swinging and start asking questions later.  It is up to you.

Exit into Tier 2~
Here stands the door back into Tier 2 of the Battle Grounds.  You can
go back by simply saying hobbit (that is how you got in here in the
first place right?).  To the north, Tier 3 of the battle grounds begin.
The mobs here are still noassist, but they are humanoid with copper
equipment.  Continue north for more info over this section, and please
be careful, it is going to get much harder here, and it is a very good
chance you can die.

Entrance into the Mines~
Welcome to Tier 3, or the underground mines.  All sorts of creatures
are here mining away at the earth.  You may comb around the mines till
you find the entrance into Tier 4, but remember you must find the password
first.  The mobiles here are humanoid and possess some equipment.  You might
not be able to wear it if the armor is not your race, or the weapon's weapon
size doesn't fit into yours, or is too heavy to wield.  You can always take
it back and break it down though.

together in some situations.  As you look around, you can see hobbits, humans, elves,
dwarves, and ogres working together to extra the resources from the ground.  However,
there appears to be no fairies though.

You see all kinds of races moving back and forth around the main loop.  There
is not many places on the face of Rafermand where you see the races like this
working in unison, so sometimes it is fun to watch them interact and see how
they can coassist.  On the other hand, you cannot really see anyone moving up
into the northern part of the mines.  Sounds like something to explore!

of the mine, you see all sorts of people moving back and forth keeping up the

Underground Mines~
It appears there are only a few workers moving in and out of this part.  They
don't appear to be miners either.  A few of them seem to be moving silently
and secretly, but not that silently and secretly.  Might be a good idea to
follow them to see what is going on.

Underground Mines~
As you move around the northern part of the mines, you notice a few suspicious
looking individuals moving to the north, and continue to move toward it, just
out from it.  They appear to not care that you are following them, which is
most likely not a good sign.  Be careful where you step.

Underground Mines~
&w&CThe mines appear to hault here all of a sudden.  Much to your good fortune
a nice wooden chest lies out in the middle of the room.  Perhaps some great
treasure has been left here for you.  Perhaps a reward for your good deeds
of finding the end of the mine, or perhaps something much more evil.

Lastly, something strange is popping out of the &w&Rdirt&w&C, might want to look at it.

Entrance into Tier 4~
The grand door into Tier 4 exists just to the north.  If you have found
the password into Tier 3, congratulations.  You are probably ready to
step out into the real world, but there are other adventurers beyond this
door if you want to step through them.  If you have not found the password,
well keep trying.

You find yourself at the bottom of the hole.  Looking up above, you

that is the only way you are getting out.

As soon as you step away from the drop area, you notice what is going

pinned up against the wall, with a few huge brutes punishing them.  It
is probably a good thing they are pounding away on the fairies instead
of watching you.

A small path~
Besides the holding cells, you notice a small path cuts south here and
then turns east.  However, it appears to endly quite quickly, and some
massive being is at the end of it.  By the looks of it, he appears to be
the one behind this hidious operation.  If he could do this to the poor
fairies, imagine what he could do to your skull :-)

The door that stands between Tier 3 and 4 is just south of here.  In
order to get back into Tier 3, all you need to do is say noven.  I
hope you received access to this area by doing that.  To the north, the
Tier 4 of the academy starts.  Be careful from here on out and read
the descriptions carefully.  If you can survive Tier 4, you are very
ready for the outside world!

Halls of Rafermand Information (err Halls of Pain Yeah!)~
Welcome to Rafermand.  These Halls will provide a wide array of information
over how to play Rafermand.  Rafermand offers a very unique system that you
will not see in any other game out there.  So, please take a few minutes to
read these descriptions and take a look at helpfiles when you need to.  If
you have any questions, please use the &w&Wnewbie&w&C channel to ask them.

You can use this channel by simply typing &w&Wnewbie&w&C along with your
message.  You are welcome back to these rooms as long as you are an actual
newbie.  Once you progress this area will be blocked off to prevent access
to some of the easier mobs in this area.  Thanks for visiting Rafermand.

Head west to learn your first lesson, the level system of Rafermand.

No levels, what will I do with my mud life then?~
Rafermand offers a No Level System.  This system allows for growth in
all areas to any extent that is wanted by the owner of Rafermand (that
would be &w&WXerves&w&C BTW).  You gain stats like hp/mana/strength by
actual doing something.  Hp is gained during battle by taking damage,
mana is gained.....using magic.  Strength is gained by using heavy
weapons during battle or by simply hauling around heavy objects.  You
can type &w&Whelp hp, help mana, help strength&w&C to get more information
about each stat.

Skills/spells are gained in similiar fashion, you use them.  Some skills
are rather easy to do this way (enhanced damage as an example, it is an automatic
combat skill making it easy to increase if you are fighting constantly).  Others
are more difficulty due to lack of use.  

Lastly, instead of training up a skill/stat in that fasion, &w&Wspoints&w&C are handed out
after each successful battle.  These can also be spent to increase a stat or a skill.
&w&WTalent&w&C is used to actually spend your spoints on skills, stats, and yes talents.
&w&R
Check out all the helpfiles for the words in white to get more information over the
command, skill, or spell.

People keep telling me I am a wussy little mort, am I?~
&w&WScore and gscore&w&C are the two main commands for viewing one's
stats.  Score contains all your stats along with a wide array of other
information used in Rafermand.  &w&WEndurance&w&C affects how well you
can move around before getting winded.  &w&WAgi (Agility)&w&C affects how fast
you can swing your weapon, &w&Wcaste&w&C has to do with &w&Wkingdoms&w&C and your position
in that kingdom (or lack of kingdom in your case).  There is also QPS that is
used in the &w&Wquest&w&C system (more on that later).  On the last line of first
section there is &w&Wspoints and sworth&w&C.  Spoints are gained after a successful
battle (as mentioned before) and sworth is your actual skill value of your player
based on your stats and skills.

3rd section of score lists your Arm/Leg Health (full white is good).  Every time
you take damage to your limbs your health in that limb decreases causing it
to break if it is fully drained.  Last 2 values are Hburn and Mburn.  If you
happen to get hit too much you will start to actual lose more hp per hit and
you will stop gaining points toward some more hp.  Same thing with mburn.

&w&WGscore&w&C is used to show how close you are to actually achieving an hp
gain or any other stat.  When you achieve a gain it is 1 full point in a stat
like strength, but it can be anywhere from 1-7 in hp or mana.

No Classes, so what is there exactly?~
As advertised, there is no class system here.  If you are looking for
a completely open "I can learn everything in this game" that is also
not available.  The game is broken up into 5 &w&Wspheres&w&C, which offer
the skills/spells that a typical class would have.  Instead of just having
a class called a ranger, you can actually model your character after a ranger.

You are not restricted in how you start to design your character.  There are
4 &w&Wtiers&w&C of skills/spells.  A Tier is a power of a skill/spell line.  The
1st tier is openly available for anyone to pick from.  Each tier is divided into
a sphere (as mentioned before) and each group is then divided into a &w&Wskillgroup&w&C.

Next thing to know about a skill/spell is that its power is measured through &w&Wskillpoints&w&C
and &w&Wmastery&w&C.  There is a total of 20 points and 6 mastery levels.  You gain points
through usage or with the &w&Wtalent&w&C command.  To gain mastery you need to actually have
a set amount of points (4 points for 2nd mastery - aka novice).  To advance to the 3rd mastery
you need 7 points and also the 2nd mastery :-).

See the helpfiles for each mastery to see the point requirements:
  &w&Wbeginner novice expert master elite flawless&w&C

So how do I actually see what the available skills and spells?~
So you know about skills/spells some now, well how can I see them you
might be asking?  &w&WListgroups&w&C is the command you will use to view
the skills/spells in the game.  &w&WSkills&w&C is the actual command you will
use to view what skills/spells/tongues you have.  The last option in the skills
command will show you the percent you have in each sphere.  This will affect
how well you learn any given skill/spell in that sphere.  When you first start

When you first start you will learn at a 70 percent or better if you have no skills or spells at
novice (2nd mastery) or at or above 6 points.  In addition to this, if you
are proficient in one area (50 percent or more) you will then start to see a
percent based on groups in that sphere (this is typically more than the percent
you have in that sphere, but it can be lower if you have all your points in one
group).  Being proficient in one sphere also helps to slow down the loss of
a skill or spell.

Loss of a skill or spell is simply caused by not using it.  This is only counted
during ingame, so if you leave for a week you won't forget everything.  The rate
at which you lose skills or spells is based on how well you know it.  If you are
a master at a skill you are going to forget it much sooner.  You can use the
&w&Wforget&w&C command to increase the loss of a skill or spell, you can also use
it to stop learning something (say you are casting create food a lot but don't want
any more points in Cleric, so you stop yourself from learning it).

Here a Tier there a Tier, such crazy things~
Ok more about &w&Wlistgroups&w&C.  Listgroups is mainly used with allgroups to
see a list of the spheres and the groups in each sphere.  You then type
listgroups <group name> to see the available skills/spells in that group.
The first thing you should notice is that each skill/spell is a certain
color.  This designates the tier of that skill or spell.  &w&YYellow is
Tier 1, &w&cDark Cyan is Tier 2, &w&CBright Cyan is Tier 3, &w&Rand Bright Red
is Tier 4.  &w&CAs mentioned before Tier 1 is the first available skills or
spells available to you, so you should focus on the yellow ones first.  You
can simply type help <name of skill> to get an idea of what it does.

Next part of listgroups is very important, the toadvance option.  This shows
you how many skills/spells at a certain Tier you need to achieve the next
Tier.  As of this writing, if you type listgroups toadvance Fire you will
get a list of Cleric and Mage requirements.  The following line is for Mage

   It will take (-2-) Tier 1 skills/spells at Novice to learn Tier 2 skills/spells.

This simply states you will need 2 Tier 1 skills (the yellow ones) at Novice (2nd mastery)
to be able to learn Tier 2 skill/spells (the dark cyan ones).  Once you achieve this you
can learn Tier 2 skills/spells like you would learn Tier 1 skill/spells.  In order to
learn Tier 2-4 you will need to leave Rolen Camp (this town) to do so.  You can type
(HELP MAP) to get the URL of the online map.  The Tier 2 skills/spells are available at
the Western University, the Tier 3 at the Eastern University.  Tier 4 is up to you to find
and discover.

Elements and Trainers, oh MY!~
The element you chose during creation will have some affect on your
magic use.  The purpose of this is to make the player resistant/susc
to the element and its opposite.  This will also affect the mana usage
of such spells.  Take a chance to check out &w&W(HELP ELEMENTS)&w&C to get
the most up-to-date description of this process.  This part has been in the
works for awhile and keeps being pushed to the backburner, so it might not
even be implemented yet.

Now that you know quite a bit about what is available, how exactly do I
learn these nice skills/spells you must be asking.  The command you use
to learn with is &w&Wlearn&w&C.  You can only learn this command at a
trainer.  Trainers are marked a &w&W[TRAINER]&w&C before his/her name.  Once
you have located a trainer you can type &w&Wlearn <name of trainer>&w&C to
view what is available from that trainer.  If the skill/spell is available
that you wish to learn, then you use the following command to actually
learn it.  &Wlearn <mobile> 'skill/spell name' [mastery].&C  You can provide the
mastery in word form (Beginner, Novice, etc) or in number form.  It will then
tell you either you cannot learn it due to no money (takes 500 coins for Beginner,
3000 for Novice, 20000 for Expert, and a nice 100,000 for Master).

More in the next room with learning spells and books.

I want to lay down the smackdown with my magic!~
Learning spells requires just a bit more.  A skill doesn't require any
extra work besides the money.  A spell requires the use of a spellbook
before it can be learned.  Typically, all the lower-mid powered spells
are freely available, but for a nice cost.  Freely meaning you don't
have to find it or kill something for it.  Tier 1 spells can be purchased
here in Rolen camp, Tier 2-3 is available in the Western and Eastern
University (along with the trainers for those spells).  The spellbooks
cost a lot more than the requirements to learn Beginner in that spell, so
sometimes it is a good idea to plan on not using a lot of magic till you
can afford to do so.

To actually purchase a book you need to find the Spellbook vendor.  It
is easy to spot the vendor because of the &w&W[SPELLBOOKS]&w&C before his/her
name.  Once you are in the room type &w&Wsbook&w&C to interact with the vendor
in the room.  You use &w&Wsbook list&w&C to actually look at a list of books.  You
can supply a name of a group after list (ex: sbook list Fire) to see a list of
only books in the Fire group.  Once you find the book you want type
&w&Wsbook buy <name of the book>&w&C to actually purchase it.  Once you have the
book, take it back to the trainer that offers the spell to actually learn
the spell.

You should know more about Skills and Spells than a mort should now...~
The skill and spell system sounds complicated, but a lot of it is
trial and good error reporting.  Just remember you can only learn the
Yellow skills/spells for now and stick with that if you are having
problems understanding.  Use listgroups toadvance to see how many
skills/spells you need at Novice so you can move on to Tier 2.  In
order to move on past Beginner (Mastery 1) in a skill/spell you will
have to leave Rolen Camp and head west to the Western University.

Once you actually have a skill or spell, you use the skills command
to view your progress in it.  You can increase your skill in that
skill or spell through use or the &w&Wtalent&w&C command.  Talent
uses spoints you gain through battle to increase your skills/spells/stats.

For a last note, it is a good idea to plan out your character even early
on.  If you put a lot of work into Cleric and Warrior and nothing into
the other 3, you will find it down right difficulty to raise your percents
in those spheres making it very hard to learn anything in those spheres.
On the other hand, this system really doesn't benefit a pure class very
much so it is a good idea to get involved as much in all the spheres as
you can.  Anyone can learn the first 2 Tiers of any sphere, so make use
of that and get you some healing and affect spells along with some combat
skills to help you survive.

Tier counting, a lot like Carb Counting?~
Last thing to know about is how far you can actually progress into any
given sphere.  As mentioned before, you can go into Tier 2 in any sphere
that you want, but there are restrictions on Tier 3-5.  As of the writing
of this area, there are no race restrictions, but that could change.  It
doesn't make a lot of sense to go Tier 4 Mage with an Ogre, but it would
be possible to do.  However, once you go Tier 4 you start to affect the
maximum amount of Tier 3s you can have.  The rule is that you can have
3 Tier 3s if you have no Tier 4s or Tier 5s.  If you have a Tier 4 (you
can only have 1 Tier 4 btw) you can have only 1 Tier 3.  If you have 1 Tier 5
you cannot have any other Tier 3s or Tier 4s.  So the formula looks like
this.

2-2-3-0-0
2-2-1-1-0
4-4-0-0-1

First number being max number of Tier 1, 2nd being max of Tier 2, the next
Tier3, then Tier4, then Tier 5.

Note:  You can still learn lower Tier skills/spells if you are in a Tier above
in that sphere, this just applies to moving up a Tier in another sphere.  You
still have to meet to requirements in toadvance though, so get all those skills
or spells when you can, otherwise you might forget key skills/spells and be
stuck relearning them.

Regular Areas and the Maps you Love.~
This is a regular area. Most if not all regular areas will 
have a map like this showing you what is around you. This 
map is 2d (will not show up or down) and is affected by 
closed/hidden doors. It will also show the sector of the 
room using a symbol &w&W(HELP SHOWASCII)&w&C. A sector is 
simply a road or a mountain. Certain sectors restrict view 
so you might not be able to see far (like in this room). 
This is not to be confused with the wilderness (which is 
discussed just to the south.)

The Wilderness System, fear the map!~
&w&WWilderness&w&C is the outside of Rolen camp. The wilderness acts as a link between 
all the areas in Rafermand (See HELP MAP and visit the website listed to view the 
playable world of Rafermand). Outside in the wilderness can be a very friendly place or a 
horrid death trap just waiting to happen. Mobs will attack you at random and their 
strength depends on the area of the wilderness along with any activity in the area. It is 
actually possible to weaken the mobs by killing a bunch of them. However, if mobs are 
left untouched out there, they will just get stronger and stronger. Typically they do 
more of the stronger and stronger part due to it actually requires an effort to kill them 
to reduce their strength. 

Besides that, the wilderness is massive and moving in it can be a very tidious process 
for the newbie adventure. You have an &w&Wendurance&w&C value in score. This affects how 
many moves it takes to move. It might only take 1 or 2 here, but outside it could take 
10-20. This is also affects by how many moves you have, the sector type you have, and 
your weight. If you are over 50 percent of your max weight, you will consume more moves 
trying to move (on the flip side you will start to gain &w&Wstrength&w&C). So it is a 
good idea to build up your endurance or save up and purchase a &w&Wmount&w&C. 

More about mounts will be covered shortly.

What else is there to know about Wilderness...Foolish Question Mortal!~
After you find that you can move, then you will have to deal with other aspects
of the system.  You will want to look for &w&W#&w&C out in the wilderness.  This
represents an exit (more like an entrance really) into a regular area.  If you check
the online map (HELP MAP, get the URL) you can get an idea where to go from there.
It is a good idea to stay close to rolen camp your first time out to get a good
idea on the strength of the enemies.  If you stay on roads you will lower your
encounter rate along with lowering the actual amount of mobs that will attempt
to kill you.  If you move off into say a forest area, you will encounter more mobs
and have a higher chance of encountering them :-(.  

Once you start fighting, it is a like normal combat (to be covered soon).  You
can flee from the mob or keep fighting.  Fleeing will put you in a random direction
away from the mob (unless you possess the retreat skill).  Once you have fled you
will have a short time to run away before they give chase.  If you run into a
zone, they will simply disappear and leave you alone.  It is a good idea to keep
an eye on your move because if it gets low you will start to lag when you move and
you are toast.  Once you flee you have a set time before you can recall or even
quit.

Lastly, you can use the &w&Wlookaround&w&C command to see more of the wilderness or use
the &w&Wwizardeye&w&C line of spells or the &w&Wscan&w&C command to see more of the
wilderness.  Make sure you have a light, you will see less during the night.

Mounts and Stuff...Yeah~
&w&WMounts&w&C as mentioned before can take a load off of your legs.

A mount can be purchased from a mount shop (HELP MAP to see where the mount shop is in 
town). You might elect to spend some of your gold on a mount. The most basic mount is 
going to have a bit more endurance than you, but not a lot more. The thing about mounts 
in Rafermand is they "grow". This means if you use the mount more it will gain more and 
more endurance. A mount's endurance maxes out higher than a players (which is 74 BTW 
without talents) making a mount a very useful companion in those long journeys. Mounts in 
Rafermand save, so you can keep your mount as long as you want. If you to let go of your 
mount, use the &w&Wsetfree&w&C command to be rid of it. Lastly, if your mount dies you will find 
it at your recall point. 

Another advantage of having a mount (if you have money this is) is the availability of feed
for your mount.  You can use the &w&Wnourish&w&C command to feed your mount food.  This will
retain lost movement for the mount.  You can purchase some feed at the Item Shop in Rolen
camp (HELP MAP).

I Died, Now What?~
&w&WDeath&w&C here isn't as horrible as in other places. If you die constantly it can be 
a bad thing through. What happens is when you die you will lose some of your points you 
are building toward gaining a full con point. You can actually lose con if you die too 
often. In Rafermand, it is quite possible that you will die often, so it is a good idea 
to keep around some extra weapons and armor to go retrieve your corpse. 

Instead of the normal 40 minutes to get a corpse you have 2 days here. After that, 
everything will fall to the ground and remain there till reboot or a crash happens. 
During that time your corpse is saved and will not be lost unless there is massive server 
problems. 

If you cannot retrieve your corpse you have a few options. First off, do not ask an 
immortal for a CR, typically they will not be given out no matter how much you ask. If you 
are a newbie with less than 100 hp, you can visit the morgue (HELP MAP) and use the 
&w&Wmorgue&w&C command to get back your corpse. You should use this as a last ditch 
solution because it will cost you 5 of your hp to do so. Your best bet is to get help from 
a player. A player can use the &w&Wdrag&w&C command to drag your corpse to safety. In order 
for this to happen you need to use the &w&Wconsent&w&C command or be grouped. Lastly, a 
high level cleric spell called &w&Wsummon corpse&w&C can be used to fetch your corpse.

Lets Forge us some Sharp, Pointy Things!~
The &w&Wforge&w&C system is used for a lot of the equipment in Rafermand. There is 
speciality equipment in areas and in questions, but a lot of the equipment you will be 
using is just straight up forged equipment. A forged piece of equipment consists of a 
certain item type (Chain Mail, Long Sword, Aventail, etc) and then it is forged with 
slabs of metal (Copper, Bronze, Iron, Steel, etc). Slabs are typically found by taking 
the weapons and armors of your fallen victims and breaking it down at a forge using the 
&w&Wforge break&w&C command. It will break the item down and you will be able to pick up 
the slabs that are left. You can then use the slabs for making new armor or weapons or 
for selling using the &w&Wforge sell&w&C command. This will be the primary way to make 
money in the first few hours till you gain access to the quest system. 

Forge equipment is racial equipment. This means when you create a short sword it will 
come out a Dwarven Short Sword or a Fairy Short Sword. The properties of these weapons 
differe based on the race. The magic difference in weapons is the weight, the weaponsize, 
and the damage. With copper equipment (the lowest and most basic forge ore) you will not 
notice a lot of difference in damage, but you will see a lot in weight (copper weights a 
lot compared to other ores) and the weaponsize doesn't differ between ores. Weapon size 
affects how fast you can swing the weapon (also if you can wield it). An ogre will not be 
able to wield a small fairy weapon because it is too small and a fairy will not be able 
to handle an ogre maul due to the fact it is massive.

My God that Ogre Maul is Fuck*n Massive!~
With armor, there is a restriction on who can use it. Only the race the armor was created 
for can use it. So if you happen to find some Elven Chain Mail and you are a Human, you 
simply need to break it, sac it, or try to sell it to someone. This *mostly* holds true 
only for forge equipment, most equipment dropped by mobs that isn't forge equipment is 
wearable by any race. With weapons, there is a weaponsize assigned to every weapon no 
matter what it is, so it is possible to find weapons your race cannot handle. As with 
weapons, ogre chain mail is going to weight more than fairy chain mail. 

Lastly, the larger the race the more slabs are required to cover your large ass. If you 
use the &w&Wforge list&w&C command you will get a list of all the forge equipment 
available. You can then supply an argument to see only a certain type (ex: &w&Wforge list 
swords&w&C). You might want to check out &w&W(HELP FORGEWEAPONS and HELP FORGEARMORS)&w&C 
for more information over the strengths and weaknesses of each weapon/armor type. Once 
you find out how many slabs you will need, you actually need to have the slabs on you. 
Due to the fact it is possible to need 40+ slabs, you can actually have the slabs on the 
ground and they will be used. 

Please go down to actually enter a forge.  The forge is 1 PC only so if someone is already
there you might have to wait.  Continue east for more non-forge training.

Lets break and make some pointy sticks~
This room is your basic forge. Only 1 PC at a time in here so that nothing can be stolen. 
Since we don't have anything to break the blacksmith here is nice enough to sell us a 
copper knife. If you use the &w&Wlist&w&C command you can see a knife up for sale. Simply 
use the &w&Wbuy&w&C command to purchase the knife. Now, you can type &w&Wforge break 
knife&w&C to break the knife. It should yield 1 slab (oh yay). You can now use this slab to 
create any forge equipment you want that requires 1 slab. You might want to buy a handful 
of knives now and break those down so you can create something useful in the next step. 

Ok time to create an actual weapon. You want to create a katana. If you type forge list 
swords you will see the katana there in your list. The slab requirement is going to be 
different for each race, so if you don't have enough slabs, buy a knife and break it till 
you do. Once you do, you use the &w&Wforge create&w&C command to create a weapon. For the 
katana you will type &w&Wforge create 1 9.&w&C The first number is the number of the ore, 
type &w&Wforge ores&w&C to see all the ores available and the number needed. The second 
number is the number of the weapon, armor, or shield you want. Once this is done you 
should see a message telling you that it was created and it is cooling. After about 20 
seconds or so it will be cool enough to pick up. If you have any extra slabs, pick them 
up or use the &w&Wforge sell&w&C command to sell the slabs for 50 gold (command is: 
&w&Wforge sell 1&w&C). The 1 is the ore number again. 

Once you are done, get your weapon and lets go back up stairs and to the east.

I want to bash some skulls mkay!~
Ok enough about how all this works, lets get down to actual combat now.  Combat
doesn't default to auto attack.  Unlike a Smaug mud where you take turns hitting
each other every 3 seconds or so, here combat rounds are half a second and it
is possible to be doing something every .5 second or you could be waiting 2 or
3 seconds to actually perform an attack or some other kind of command.  We will
stick with auto-combat turned off for now.  In order to actually strike at the
enemy you can use the &w&Wattack, murder, or kill&w&C command.  There is absolutely
no difference between the 3 commands, so pick your favorite.

Ok, we now know the command, so what do we do.  The syntax for attack is as following:
&w&Wattack <target> <limb>&w&C.  You choose the target then you choose the limb.  The
limb target has the following selections &w&Wrarm larm lleg rleg body head neck&w&C.  If
you fail to leave off a limb you will target the body.  Once you start fighting you
can try to spam attack but you will see the following message: 

   You can't move that fast! Wait 1 and a half more seconds...

This means you have 3 rounds before you can attack again or do anything else for that
matter.  Majority of commands you would think wouldn't work in combat will not and
stuff like chat and look will work even if you cannot perform a move.  Even removing
a weapon and wielding another will take up rounds of a fight so be aware of these
things.

I said I want to bash some skulls not slash some skulls!~
Ok you have the basic of attack down, now to move on to &w&Wgrip&w&C.  No,
this isn't losing your cool, this is how you grip your weapon.  You have
the following choices for grip: &w&Wslash, stab, bash&w&C.  The 3 attacks
affect a lot in how well you rounds of combat will go.  For starters, each
weapon is typically best at doing 1 of the 3.  A club is best used bashing,
a dagger for stabbing, and a sword for slashing.  A club has the best chance
to actually do damage, but it also has a wide tohit spread meaning it will
do less damage over time.  Stab, on the other hand, will tend to hit less, but
it will do more damage because the tohit spread is much smaller.  Slash is
the middle of the 2.

Also, other things to consider is armor and limb damage.  Bash is going to do
a lot more damage to armor and to the limb of the poor victim than stabbing at
the guy.  However, stabbing to the neck and the head has a higher chance of
landing a &w&Wdeathblow&w&C.  A deathblow kills the enemy in one swipe no matter
how much life is left.  Slash has the best chance to land an attack that will
slice off a limb.  All 3 have an equal chance to land a &w&Wcrit&w&C.  A crit
is just short for a critical hit.  A crit will do more damage than a normal hit.

Boy that is a big weapon~
As mentioned before in the forging sections, weaponsize is generated by
the size of the weapon and the race that created it.  Your race has a
certain range it can wield.  The closer you are to the bottom of that
range, the faster you will attack.  The closer you are to the top, the
slower you will attack &w&W(HELP WEAPONSIZEMORT)&w&C.  Typically, larger
weapons like mauls will take longer to attack with, but the damage output
is higher and tohit is greater.  On the flip side, when using heavy weapons
you will start to lose your agility (but gain your strength).  If you use
light weapons you will lose some strength and gain agility.  Sometimes it is
good to choose the middle ground so you gain both.

Now that we understand all of that, lets discuss shields &w&W(HELP SHIELDS)&W&C.  Make
sure to see HELP SHIELDS not HELP SHIELD, SHIELD is the spell.  Shields can be used
to deflect damage.   A shield has a lag value, a condition value, and a block percentage
value.  The smaller the shield the lower all 3, the larger the shield the larger value
for all 3.  There is also the 2-handed pavis that allows you to block an army of arrows,
but you will not be able to attack with it.  Lastly, there is the &w&Wshieldblock&w&C skill
that can be used to increase the chance to shieldblock while decreasing lag.

Father always told me to be aggressive~
Rafermand offers an Aggression system that can be used to handle fighting with more than 
one person &w&W(HELP AGGRESSION)&w&C. Every time you do anything to a mob you are 
assigned aggression toward that mob. This typically consists of doing damage to a mob, 
but this also affects commands such as &w&Winsult&w&C and healing. Healing a player is 
the fastest way to gain aggression during a battle. It is typically good to learn if you 
plan on tanking what it takes to hold aggro. For most of the time, this is not going to 
be important though. 

Now that we have all this manual stuff down, lets discuss &w&Wtarget&w&C. The target 
command tells your player to attack every chance he/she gets. You can use &w&Wtarget 
<limb> and target <grip>&w&C to choose the defaults for your attacks (NOTE: target will 
override what you chosen with grip, it is always important to see your grip in target if 
you plan on using it). Once you have everything set it is time for a fight. Now you 
should notice your player is attacking every chance he/she can. Only problem is you need 
to heal, BAD! You can try to spam that spell or potion in, or you can use the 
&w&Wstack&w&C command. The stack command will perform the commands you tell it before 
going on with an auto-attack. See the helpfile on how todo multi-line stacks.

God my brain hurts....lets review more foolish mortal!~
That is the basics of combat.  There is also hand-to-hand skills that
can be used instead of weapons &w&W(HELP HAND-TO-HAND)&w&C and of course
magic spells.  It is a good idea to get to know your affect spells like
bless, armor, and shield.  Also get to know what can help you survive
in combat higher on up (sanctuary, sanctify, stone skin).  Once you
understand that, then the only thing to worry about is the enemy
actually attacking back.

Enemies can use forge weapons if they are humanoid (humans, elves, etc).
Depending on the intelligence of the mob, the thing can strike at your
weaknesses or simply will keep hacking away at your chest.  The academy
mobs (the one you will get to beat on in here and out in the Battle Grounds)
&w&WWILL ALWAYS TARGET YOUR BODY&w&C.  However, out in the scary places in
the wilderness, it is hard telling what they will target.  So stay equiped
and make sure the hand you selected at creation is protected.  Mobs tend
to swing at your good hand, so keep that in mind when picking up armor.

You will find 2 mobs in here (if they aren't already dead).  The Battle Dummy
will not attack back, so you are welcome to try a few hits on the poor guy.
The Combat Dummy will actually attack back (not very hard though)
When fighting you will see a meter that looks like this: &w&G(&w&R****&w&Y**&w&C**&w&P**&w&G)&w&C.  This
indicates how much health your target has left.

Who is Up for a Quest?  Foolish morts know not what they do!~
Quest System is one of the features that has been added recently and will become a main 
staple in Rafermand's Present and Future. The Quest system is a fully automated, random 
area/mob/loot generating machine. You use the &w&Wquest&w&C command to actually interface 
with it. You need to find the questor mob &w&W(QUESS WHAT HELP MAP)&w&C to locate the 
questor mob. You then have the following options: <difficulty> <mission> <size> <mob count> 
[extra time (-1 to 10)] You need to provide all of those options (except the extra time). 
You can choose a difficulty from 1 to 13 (start with 1 if you are sane) then you can choose 
the mission, the size, the mob count, and any extra time if you want. This command is going 
to change and be updated often, so check the helpfiles for the most recent changes to this 
code. As of the writing there was only a slaughter quest. 

Once this is done you actually can visit a quest. If you check out the online map (HELP 
MAP) you can see there are 5 quest zones out in the Wilderness. Go in order till you find 
your quest entrance. Once you enter you have a certain amount of time to finish your 
quest. Any loot you find during it belongs to you. If you complete the quest in time you 
will be rewarded with &w&WQPS&w&C that you can spend on even more loot and goodies.

So where is that big nasty guy with the big pointy teeth?~
Each quest will load at least a captain and if it is size 2 or higher,
a boss.  These enemies are harder than the typically trash that is
occupying the quest zone.  These mobs also will load gold and loot.
The best way to earn gold in Rafermand is to quest for it.  The captain
and boss mobs will give you enough loot to start purchasing those books
that you REALLY need so you can learn those LEET spells you want.  However,
these mobs tend to be 2-3 levels in difficulty higher than the other
mobs.  So if you are having troubles handling the normal mobs in a 3, you
might not want to try a boss, because it will most likely end up a giant
mess.

Another nice things about quests are they are death friendly.  You can
use the &w&Wmorgue&w&C command to get your corpse (costs QPS though) or
you can wait till the quest shuts down and your corpse will be delivered
to the morque for you, free of charge.  Each quest zone is unique for the
player (or group) playing that quest zone.  So, there is no waiting for
a quest zone to open up, you just start a quest and start hacking away
at it.  You do have a time limit (unless you choose not to have one) so
you cannot hack away forever.

OK these underlined thingys have been driving me nuts!!!~
This mud is &w&WMXP&w&C enabled.  If you are using zmud or mushclient (and
hopefully more clients to be named later) you might see what looks like
a HTML hyperlink.  If you hover over it you will get a short description
of what it does.  If you don't see this, you don't have the mentioned clients
or your client is so old it doesn't support MXP.  A lot of the commands
listed in this walkthrough or MXP enabled so you simply have to click on
the command (or right click on it) to get some options.  I would recommand
using an MXP enabled client if you have a chance.

Another nice thing about &eM&fXP&E&E&C that will be used more as more clients are
available is the use of colors.  If you use the &&e as a color symbol, if you
are using a MXP client, you will see a pinkish color that is not a typical
color for muds.  In addition to this, Zmud supports the use of inline images
to actually show pictures inside a mud.  There isn't a lot of this, but all
of the hooks and even a test wilderness (see the MXP command) is available for
later use.  It also supports loading of multiple windows for redirection text
and multiple other goodies that could be of use to players.  So, I hope you
choose to use a MXP enabled client or support a free one when it becomes available
for the players.

Why is a darked skinned elf talking to me?~
Rafermand uses an Introduction system.  When you first enter Rafermand
you see a combination of racially descriptive names, some people with a
title (such as Lord or King) and perhaps even a Full and Last Name.  What
you see depends a lot on the fame of the person and if the immortals have
certain flags set on or off.  Also, it is possible to see a cloaked
individual.  A cloaked individual is someone use a &w&Wcloak&w&C and uses
the &w&Whood&w&C command to hide his/her identity.  This can be useful if
you don't want people knowing who you are or simply just to fool people
into perhaps believing you are someone you are not.

You can use the &w&Wintroduce&w&C command to actually introduce yourself to
another player (and hope they extend the curtesy).  Once you are introduced to
a person, you will remember that person for a good 6 real life months.  It is
possible to forget a person over time if they don't log.  Fame, which makes it
possible for strangers to know you, is gained through a vareity of different
ways, all of which will not be discussed here.  Lastly, just because you are
cloaked doesn't mean you won't get flagged for murdering someone.  The one
who was killed or attacked plus anyone observing will have you flagged for
the crime.  Even if you are cloaked you will still come up as an attacker, so
be careful what you do.  If you wish to excuse such crimes, you can use the
&w&Wpardon&w&C command to forgive the person.

Is it ok for me to slay player X and spit on his dead corpse?~
Answer is yes and no.  Rafermand doesn't offer a pkill or safe option
like most muds, the game decides this for you.  Certain areas of the
game will change the pkill status.  We use something called a &w&WFANS&w&C
system here.  It stands for Full-loot, An Item, No Loot, and Safe.  Safe is
the only non-pkill flagging in the game.  The newbie areas tend to be Safe
along with some other "neutral areas".  No Loot is the most common of the
pkill flags.  No loot simply means you can kill someone, but you are not
allowed to loot the corpse.  An Item simply means an item is dropped upon
death and is open for looting.  Full-loot is exactly as it sounds.

If you are using the default prompt you should see your PK status in red.
Areas tend to be only 1 PK status, but out in the wilderness it is different.
When you are near a road it is noloot.  However, when you start to get away
from roads it will change to anitem.  So, in short be careful unless you want
to rumble with someone.  If that is so, take it to the forest.

It is good to be King, yes!~
Another feature Rafermand offers is a vast &w&Wkingdom&w&C system.  Think
of it as a clan system on steroids.  It allows the owner of the kingdom (the
King) to control many aspects such as creation, building, workers, military,
etc.  Kingdoms are built on the Wilderness map and make use of the surrounding
to build up the kingdom.  To start a kingdom, the &w&Wstartkingdom&w&C command
is used.  However, first you need the 400,000 coins to start a kingdom plus the
command has to be open to the public (at times new kingdoms are not allowed to
be created).  Once a kingdom is created, it will exist at the spot that you are
standing on the map.  All changes and building you do will actually be on the
wilderness map not in an area (cool, you bet it is).

Once in control you can choose to let people in your kingdom, or not.  You can
assign people &w&Wjobs&w&C in your kingdom so they can actually go and &w&Wextract&w&C
resources for your new &w&Wtown&w&C.  Once you gain enough money through taxes, you
will be able to purchase military units to guard your land.  Your land is is controlled
through the &w&WAOC&w&C.  AOC (Area of Control) is determined by the size of your town.
You cannot be in conflict of any other kingdom's AOC or neither town will be able
to grow.  It would take about 10-15 rooms to explain this in detail, so check out
&w&W(HELP KINGDOMS, HELP KINGDOM COMMANDS, HELP JOBS, HELP BUILD)&w&C for more information.

Time for a break...well perhaps~
Well, this covers what you need to know to get started.  There is a mob
in here that will teleport you back to the beginning if you simply say
the following: &w&Pget me out of here&w&C.  If you wish to continue and
learn more, continue to the south.  It is adviced to continue, but if you
are tired of reading, now might be a good time to check out the Battle
Grounds and smack around some poor critters.

You cannot rob me, I have it all in the bank!~
Banking is a very important part of Rafermand.  Banks are used to store
any of that extra cash you have along with extra loot you cannot haul.  It
is very important to keep some extra gear just in case you have to go do
a CR, so it is important to have knowledge of how a &w&Wbank&w&C works.
The following commands are used with banking:  &w&Wbalance deposit withdraw trans&w&C.
Balance servies a dual role, it will show you how much gold you have in the
bank and you can use the optional argument &w&Wbalance buy&w&C to check out how
much it will cost to increase your bank hold.  A bank hold is what is used to
store 1 weight of any item or 10k coins.  You start the game with a 200 bank
hold, which is a lot of coins but you will find not enough storage if you start
stocking up on extra loot.

&w&WDeposit&w&C can be used to deposit either gold or loot.  You can deposit anything
you want, just remember if an item is &w&Wunique&w&C that the game will only allow
1 copy of that object on your player no matter where it is.  You can also deposit
containers if you want.  &w&WWithdraw&w&C is used to withdraw gold or any item from
your account.  There is alwo the list option to see what loot you have held up in
your bank account.   Lastly, &w&Wtrans&w&C is used to transfer gold from one player
to another.  Both players must be online.

Where did the time go?~
If you use the &w&Wdate&w&C command you should notice the game time.  Game
time means a lot more here than it does in a typical Smaug mud.  The game time
is always going and is based on a set time (90 seconds RL = 1 hour GT).  See
&w&W(HELP TIME INFO)&w&C for what it boils down to for things such as days
and months.  The thing to know about the calendar here is that it is 360
day based, not 365-366.  There are 30 days in each month and 24 hours in
a day. 

Why is this important you might ask?  If and when the weather system gets put
back in, you will have to worry about snow and tornados first of all.  Second,
the harvest seasons for kingdoms run around this calendar, so it is a good idea
to know when to start &w&W(HELP HARVEST&w&C).  In addition, like most Smaug muds,
there is day and night and the game time affects when this will happen.

Paging an immortal, are you there?~
Primary way that communication is done between imms and players (besides the normal use 
of chat of course) is through 3 ways. The first is the use of the &w&Wgboard&w&C system. 
Gboard is short for Global Boards. These boards are readable anywhere and require nothing 
to use. Typically, the gboard is used mainly for announcements from the immortals to the 
players. Most in game reports of bugs and ideas are now handled through the &w&Wproject&w&C 
command. To see the gboards simply type &w&Wgboard&w&C. To choose one of the available gboards 
type &w&Wgboard <num>&w&C. Then type &w&Wgnote list&w&C to see the notes on the board. Then you 
type &w&Wgnote read <number>&w&C to read the actual note. 

Next is the &w&Wproject&w&C command.  The project command is used to report bugs, ideas,
typos, and for immortals to report on their own projects.  You use the &w&Wproject show&w&C
command to view a project and then the &w&Wproject add type <short desc>&w&C command to actually
add a new project.  There are a lot more options, please check the project helpfile for
more information.

Lastly, the &w&Wchanges&w&C command is how changes are reported.  Any change that is made
to the game will be posted to this file.  This will include mostly things that affect
Rafermand, but it will also contain other changes that people who are using the codebase
will want to know about.  You can use the command &w&Wchanges -1&w&C to see the first 30
lines or simply replace the -1 with any number of lines you want.  You can view the whole
thing by visiting the website listed.

You said something about me, you bastard!~
Missing some savory chat messages is what every adventurer fears, I know
I did.  You do not have to fear though my uninformed friend for you have
access to &w&Wchistory&w&C.  Chistory (short for channel history) allows
you to go back and read that chat log.  Chistory currently supports the
follow channels:  chat tell say kingdom newbie avtalk immortal.  Of course
if you don't have access to the channel you will not be able to read it, but
the public ones you are welcome to read.  Since tell and say are character
related, these logs are stored on the character.  The other channels are mud
wide and are stored on the mud.  After a copyover, reboot, or a crash these
logs will be gone, so make sure to read up on your gossip before you logout
of Rafermand.

An important tidbit is that these logs will actually not tell you the name
of the person if you do not know it.  If the person was cloaked when he/she
talked that person will show up as cloaked in the logs.  So, this is not
a way to cheat the system.

Captain, my mud client needs more SPEED!~
Added in 2.0, the &w&Wspeed&w&C command is very very important.  You
do not know it, but you are actually set to the speed of 3.  What this
does is open up a larger pipe to your client.  How it works is that
in a normal mud only 512 bytes of data is sent to your client in 1 second.
This can cause problems if you are say out in the wilderness and pulling
up large ascii maps full of all sorts of crap.  Most importantly it is
just a pain trying to parse through some kind of room or posting that scrolls
for 150 lines.  This will actually make the text go by much faster.  The 
default for speed is set to around &w&W2048 bytes (2 Kilobytes)&w&C.  This should be
sufficient for most things, but when you start to see scroll lag you might
want to increase it.

You can use the speed command to either decrease it back down to 512 bytes
or move it up 7860 bytes (7.8 Kilobytes) by using the &w&Wspeed 6&w&C command.
It is not recommended to do this if you are connection from a modem because
the top speed on a modem is around 5 Kilobytes a second (can see the problem
there I hope).  If you are using any kind of broadband, just jack it up to
6 and never look back.  If you are on a modem, leaving it at 3 is your best
bet (which is the default).

I don't like walking, what else is there?~
Well glad you asked :-).  Outside in the wilderness there are &w&Wportals&w&C
that you cannot see.  Portals become viewable by using the &w&Wmarkportal&w&C
command when you find a portal.  However, to actually see the portals to mark
it you first need to turn on &w&Whuntportals&w&C.  This needs to be done at the
portal room in Rolen &w&W(HELP MAP&w&C).  The portal room can also be used as
a portal itself once you find portals out in the wilderness.  Once you have huntportals
turned on you will be able to mark them.  However, be cautioned that when you
are hunting portals you cannot use recall, astral, summon, portal, etc.  You have
to walk to your destination to mark it.  Portals are typically located 5-15 rooms
from an area, just walk around the area till you find it.  You will see the following
symbol for a portal &w&BO&w&C.  Once you find it, goto that room and use markportal
to mark it (NOTE:  If you are not following, this is done in the wilderness not in
an area).

Once you have it marked, you can use the &w&Wlistportals&w&C command to actually view
what portals you have marked.  Then you can either use a rune that you buy at the
magic shop in Rolen or use the &w&Wastral walk or portal&w&C spell to use the portals.
Please check out &w&W(HELP PORTALS HELP PORTAL HELP ASTRAL WALK)&w&C for a bit more
detailed information.

Copyovers and stuff (Sorry I am running out of funny)~
&w&WCopyover&w&C also known as warmboot is the method the admins use to
put in new code or fix problems.  This is a widely used system now, but
just in case you don't know, I will explain (plus mention how ours works).
Copyover is used mainly to keep players connected while a new game is being
started, once the game is up, the connections are moved over to the new game
and the players will simply start back where they were, no disconnects.  This
typically takes 2-3 seconds, but it can take longer depending server load and
other odd things.  Your player is saved along with any thing else that would
normally be saved using the save command, but the world as it is along with any
mobs and objects on the ground is not saved.  The only exception to this are
quest areas.  All data in a quest area is saved and restored during a copyover.
Only thing that might not be there is your fight session, but that will start
as soon as the game is back up anyway.

It is not typical to be reimbursed for anything lost during a copyover.  Typically,
at least 1 minute is given as a warning and the immortals try not to do a copyover
when they know a player is away.  If you need an imm to stop a copyover, tell that
imm immidately.

Sometimes it is a good idea to play the race card.~
Perhaps you didn't get to take a good luck at your race before you
started.  Race plays a very important part in how you will play the game
in Rafermand.  If you started as an ogre, your magical ability is going
to suffer as you grow in power.  However, you will be the choice for taking
and dealing out damage (for the most part).

Elves tend to be like humans, good at just about everything. Elves require less 
ore than humans, use less mana than humans, and learn magic at a decent rate. 
Humans can go deeper into the talent pool, gain more spoints and learn faster 
through use. Both races work well as an all around race, but if you plan on 
going stronger toward magic, an elf might be your best bet. 

Dwarves are fairly good with everything, but they really shine when it comes down
to healing.  Dwarves get a bonus toward healing that makes their healing ability
better than any other race.  Dwarves also can see in the dark and are better at
using skills such as &w&Wfix&w&C and &w&Wbreak&w&C.  When and if tradeskills make
it into the game, dwarves will also receive bonuses in that area.  Lastly dwarves
also make decent tanks because they do have decent con and hp gains.

What about the other races?~
Hobbits are an interesting race not played by too many (that could perhaps
change).  Hobbits have an knack for learning the arts of stealth and thieving.
They get a bonus toward haggling and swindling (even if you don't have the skills).
They also get a bonus to dodge.  However, hobbits cannot wear heavy armor, so they
don't do too well as tanks for that purpose alone.  Hobbits require less ore than
elves so they are easy to equip and their ability to take damage is much better than
that of a fairy, so there you go.  The one very bad thing about hobbits, you have
to keep eating (sorry).

Fairies are perhaps the worst or best race depending on how well you can play your
character.  Fairies tend to shine when it involves the arcane arts.  Magic is the game
of the fairy, swinging weapons are not.  It is always good to know how to swing a weapon,
but fairies are susceptible to non-magical damage, so taking hits just doesn't work out
all that well.  On the other side, they learn magic at an exceptional speed and require
less mana and do more damage with their spells than the other races.  With the ability
to learn masteries like &w&WElite and Flawless&w&C, the magic consumption will dwindle and dwindle
and the fairy will become a magic casting machine.

Who said I am not talented?~
The &w&Wtalent&w&C command serves multiple purposes. As discussed earlier in this little 
zone of fun, talent can be used to increase one's skills or stats. This is done using 
your spoints toward a full point or just a star. A star is 1/10 of a point. You will 
notice 10 stars for each skill or stat when you use gscore or skills (well it is really 
an asterisk but a star just sounds better). You can use the cost argument for both to get 
the number of spoints it will cost for a star and a whole point. Skills will increase in 
value as you gain points, also higher tiers will cost more points than the lower tiers. 
For stats, it mostly depends on how much hp and mana you have. It will cost more to 
increase strength after playing 100 hours and having 400 hp compared to having only 
played 1 hour and having 25 hp. 

As for the actual talents, these consist of quite a few things. You can use the 
&w&Wtalent list&w&C command to get a list of talents. You will only see the ones 
available to your race, so there could be others for different races. This is sometimes 
being worked on all the time, so check out the talent helpfile when you can. Mostly it 
will consist of increasing certain barriers like maximum damage or your cap on some stat. 
It will also add in other abilities that might only be available through the talent 
command. Check it out, ask some players, have fun. For now though, looking will be mainly 
it, talents cost a lot of spoints.

That is all for now, you can go now!~
This is all the academy has to offer for now.  Check back later if you
want to see if anything new has been added.  Hopefully by then you will
be playing actively and have been keeping up with updates and there will
be no need.  Skien is here again to bring you back to the entrance of
the Academy, simply say:  &w&Pget me out of here&w&C.  Good luck with
your adventures, please feel free to use chat or newbie to ask any questions
you still might have.
