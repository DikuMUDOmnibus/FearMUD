A beautiful elven maiden is standing here

This fair skinned elven lady with hair of raven black and full red
lips, is standing here singing softly while picking mushrooms
here in the forest.  She is about 5'6 and is fairly skinny, but
not scrawny, but beautiful in shape.  Her bosom is nice and round
and her head is held high in the great embrace of the wind.

A strange looking elf, that doesn't even include the fact that he is
flying in the air.  Neal has very very very long Orange hair that moves
about the air in a circular motion when he moves around and his face is
covered in some really strange orange looking dots.  He is either stricken
with some disease, or was removed from his dwelling because he looked like
that.

The trail is worn down by use and the dirt is hardpacked from traveler's
feet.  To the west of you, there is a HUGE tree.  This tree is so tall
that you'd have to climb it to see what its branches look like.
The tree already casts a long shadow upon the ground from the rising
sun.

The hard packed dirt seems to have dwindled off and now there is
nice, soft, rich soil.  There doesn't seem to be any footprints
in the soil, stepping on the soil proves it right.  Your foot
doesn't sink but still stays above the soil.  In fact it DOES
stay above the soil.  Your floating above the ground!  It won't
last long though...

The dirt beneath your feet is hard packed and worn down from use.
There are leaves on the sides of the path, and some on the path too,
making a crunching sound whenever you step on one.  This side of the
tree seems to have fall qualities, leaves of different colors, a 
coldness to the wind, and not much warmth from the sun.

The branch seems to be...sick.  The branch is spotted with yellow,

Beautiful.  The branch is a gleaming, pure, clear, crystal.  The 
leaves are crystalized waterdrops from the pure rain of the sky.

The bark underneath crumbles and peels away from even the lightest

sunshine and rain, on this side of the tree. There are murky and
dark clouds in the west sky, and the ground seems to be barren past the
trees to the west.  To the northwest, there is a branch that seems 
withered, and to the southeast....well you can't tell since it's pretty

The branch continues on.~
The air seems to have cooled off and the sky has slackened off its
warmth a tad bit.  There are now nests of the birds that have been seen
before and there are speckled eggs in them.  Touching them reveals that
they are still warm from early mother-sitting-down nest incubation.
Hopefully they will hatch into beautiful birds.

Paradise.~
&CYou are not at the end of the branch.  There is now millions of 
colors floating into your eyes.  &rRed wings &Cof different types of
birds, &ggreen, &Cbeautiful leaves hanging upon rich brown bark,
and best of all, just beyond the end of the branch, a lake full
of clear &Bblue water&C, with a giant roaring, and splashing
waterfall adding even more water to that lake.  Around the lake,
there are beautiful trees making a circle around it.
So in meaning, you are not at the end of the branch but at the beginning
of paradise.

In front of the light there is a sign made out of the very bark of the

of the tree's huge roots are here, they are about 5 feet tall.  There
are little roots on the walls of the dirt, probably from small little
plants and the grass.  There's a ladder for you to climb, so you can

you with a slap on the back and a couple of terrifying near misses with his
juggled weapons of mass destruction.  He invites you to come in and have

crumble even more with every small movement you take.  Hopefully,

from the walls, no stones, no breaks in the wall.  The wall looks like
it was smoothed out by the master masons.  There is a small wooden table
in the middle of the room, surrounded by 4 chairs, one chair at each
end.  In the middle of the table is a vase of &rred &Croses, the vase
itself is 3 different colors mixed together in different swirls, a

A &Bblue &C&Wroom of crystal.~
This entire room is blue from the blue crystal that is embedded into
the ground, walls, and ceilings, and they're glowing from the light
from the hole in the ceiling, in which turn they reflect towards
each other which then reflect back, giving this room a pure sky
blue color.  That smell that was in that tunnel hasn't come around
for a little while....strange...

A red room of a large ruby.~
Two holes are on each side of the room, shining inwards towards a 
pedestal that holds a red ruby.  The ruby is glowing mysteriously
with the light from the two holes.  The ruby looks very enchanting
and seems to croon at your soul.  Fighting it off, you better get
the hell out of here.

A plain old tunnel.~
Oh man, another tunnel.  Except for this one has stone walls, and a
crystal path.  There's no light except for yours and there is no
fresh air from any holes.  What's worse is that the smell has come
again, and it's worse, but even closer.  The source is close now,
the goal of all this damn walking.

The tunnel continues.~
The walls of the tunnel are a little caved in.  Maybe a good 5 inches 
from each side of you.  Kind of cramped and small in between.  The
trail is hard dirt and sharp small rocks line the way into the cavern.
The smell is closer now, as though, each step takes you closer to
the source, and goal.

A huge sticky web.~
It's another one of those huge webs that has been encountered before.
Again, thousands of little arachnid spiders line the smaller webs
along the big one.  The smell has gotten worse and seems to be coming
from the northwest.  Careful, don't step on any of the poisonous
spiders!

Another cave.~
Here's another cave.  Except this one is the exact opposite of the last
one you were just in.  The walls are not beautiful crystal or rubies,
but deep black granite.  There is no air/light hole in the ceiling 
above.  The smell seems to thicken the air to a degree where breathing
sometimes, might be a bad idea.  The source, however, is definetely
getting closer.

Molten lava covered walls.~
The walls of this part of the cavern are cooled off lava.  However, 
the heat is still radiating from some holes, and some odd places still
have red hot spots showing up, and blowing holes.  The cavern is almost
unbearably hot, and the smell is mixed up with the heat, giving the
air an almost unbreathable, suffocating, and smelly mixture.

Darkness.~
There's nothing here.  Nada, goose egg, zip, nitcho, NOTHING!!!
All there seems to be is a narrow, short bridge from where
you are to the other side, and two very dark, and VERY big, steep,
pits.  Careful of your step.  You do NOT want to fall.

A guard room.~
The walls are actually wooden planks now.  There's a normal small
wooden table in the middle of the room, a chair, cupboards for 
supplies, and a small fireplace.  A wooden door leads to the east.
Dust outlines a hatch below; it looks as if it hasn't been used in a while.
Testing the doorknob reveals that the door is unlocked.  Now, how
ironic is that?  A guard room, with an unlocked door?  Tsk, tsk, tsk.

The walkway continues on to the north, as does that horrible smell 
which is VERY strong and close.  The way back is only to the southwest.
Got enough guts to continue on to see the mystery of the smell,
what the source is, and if there are any rewards in it?

Whoah.  That's one BIG door.  The door has a symbol of a box on it,
and that box has a keyhole that kind of looks like a symbol on it.
There's something written under the box, why don't you look at the
INSCRIPTION?!  HMMM?!??!  WHY DON'T YOU?  CAN'T READ?!!??
Besides.  The door is unlocked, why don't you just go into the room...

The smell....STOPS!~
HERE'S where the source of that god awful smell.  The room is very
plain, with wood all around, and is quite moderate in size.  There
doesn't seem to be much fresh air and that smell is quite thick in
this room.  Watch your back, cause anything can happen if you wait
long enough.
