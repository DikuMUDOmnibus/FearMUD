Door Guardian~
The Door Guardian stands stern as to allow no one to continue.
~
Not much can be seen of the guardian because he is fully clad in some
wierd kind of armor.  All that can be seen is he is one big, bad mother
fu**er and you should think twice about picking a fight with him.

Rinker~
Rinker is here permitting none to continue on to the trainers.

Rinker can be summed up as such: big and nasty looking.  Being down here
in this hole has made him most likely the ugliest looking ogre to walk
the earth, but he has gained great strength.

hitting very hard.

Uthi~
Uthi~
Uthi is here to drop anyone that wishes to continue
~
The many years in this place have disconfigured Uthi into something almost
beast like.  The only thing that still makes him human is his eyes, that
is the look not the soul behind.  Looking too much into them will cause
any creature to turn evil just like him.

Siena~
Siena is here guarding the entrance to the trainers.

Looking at this poor hidious beast makes you feel almost sorry for it.
Hobbits aren't exactly the most charismatic of all creatures, but poor
Siena looks like she has lived about 5 lives and then beaten with an
ugly stick.

Riveur is here looking for blood to suck.

Just looking at this freek can give anyone the creeps.  He appears to
look like an average man in his 30s, but with blood stains all over
his almost naked body adds a sight you will never get out of your
head.  It might be a good idea to kill him quickly or forever be
plaqued with his grotesque image all your life.

Aquen~
Aquen~
Aquen is here offering death to anyone that wishes to pass.
~
Although Aquen does not stand very tall, the pure energy that radiates from
her is enough to scare any living creature to go back to their homes and beg
for forgiveness.  Also of an odd note, where most creatures are strickened by
some kind of disfigurement here, Aquen has regained a very pure beautiful and
an agelessness rarely seen.  Perhaps it is all an illusion though.

Entrance to the Dungeon of Rantharg~
The path running out into the desert looks like bliss compared to the
one leading into the dungeon.  Many nasty things creep along the winding
paths inside, then again many treasures lay buried deep in the dungeon
too.  One would have to be extremely brave to continue on when most would
start running to the outside world now!

Rantharg Dungeon~
Not much can be learned from the surroundings besides that it 
is dark and the walls are very unforgiving. The darkness and 
monotony can only make it next to impossible to keep a true 
path, and a trail can be lost in an instant. It could be very 
difficult indeed to find a way back out, not to mention all the 
nasties lurking around everywhere.

The walls appear to be a little red here, mostly from the 
blood that once poured from the poor, dead individual who is 
rotting on the cave floor. That alone should be enough to urge 
the adventurer onward, but added to the atmosphere of the place 
the urge is overwhelming. Of course, as is evident, some people 
take the easy way out.

you have is a bloody weapon.  How sad...

Just as this place looks like it cannot get any blander, a room as bland as this
just suddenly appears, how sad!  Well, if you continue looking at the walls, you
will eventually die, so well that is an easy way out!

Not much can be learned by your surroundings besides that it is dark and the
walls look very unforgiving.  If you aren't keep tracking of where you are going
and where you have been, you might have a small problem getting out of this
place, not to mention all the nasties waiting around to chew on you!

More dirty walls, more dirty trails, more blood.  Perhaps if you brought with you
a flute you could of increased your joy while in this bloody dungeon from hell, then
again it would be fun for them to all run right for you and kill you too.  Yes, I think
that would appeaze the gods!

A few skulls line the ground in this very room, it appears one of them still has a few

It sounds like the sounds of children playing can be heard not too far away from here.
Come to think about it, why would children be playing here.  Perhaps it is a trap or
perhaps it is some CANDY!  Yes candy, you know you want some right now, instead all
you have is a bloody weapon.  How sad...

Just as you couldn't take another horrible sight, another one appears here.  A very
dead elf is here with about 25 small spears stuck into the poor things body.  The
scary part is the spears aren't very sharp, poor thing!

The walls appear to be a little red here, mostly from the blood that once poured
from the poor, dead individual who is rotting right here.  You better move faster
if you don't want to become like the poor lad - that is if you don't want to take
the easy way out like he did!

The gods have smiled on you friend, this room appears to be free of the dread and gloom
of the read of the dungeon.  If you are looking to take a quick breather, inhale that
nice pastry you brought with you, or anything that might get you killed anywhere else,
this would probably be a good place to do it.  Or at least lets hope so....

Just as this place looks like it cannot get any blander, a room as bland as this
just suddenly appears, how sad!  Well, if you continue looking at the walls, you
will eventually die, so well that is an easy way out!

What a god forsaken place this appears to be, it might be a good idea
not to go this way, then again it might be a good idea to continue on
and find out what awaits you.

pointy bits that are lodged in it.  Oh well.

All the paths are starting to look the same here, perhaps you have already been
here, or perhaps you know where you are going.  Or perhaps those sounds you are
starting to hear are getting closer and closer to you, now would be a good time
to be looking around for friends....What you don't have more than that?

More dirty walls, more dirty trails, more blood.  Perhaps if you brought with you
a flute you could of increased your joy while in this bloody dungeon from hell, then
again it would be fun for them to all run right for you and kill you too.  Yes, I think
that would appeaze the gods!

It sounds like the sounds of children playing can be heard not too far away from here.
Come to think about it, why would children be playing here.  Perhaps it is a trap or
perhaps it is some CANDY!  Yes candy, you know you want some right now, instead all
you have is a bloody weapon.  How sad...

from the poor, dead individual who is rotting right here.  You better move faster

A giant hole drops down from here, further into the ground than where

light down belong and it seems like the dreaded place is eating up any

A giant hole leading to the maze above is only reachable if you can

darkness running to the east.  The maze was a great joy to behold, being
even deeper into it should make it even more enjoyable, yes, yes indeed!

Deep Underground~
Falling even deeper than the dungeon section, you are now far into the
ground.  The smell down here is 3 times worse than the dungeon, that
can only mean some big nasty critters are down here and are not going
to welcome you with a cup of tee.  Might be a good idea to rest up
if you are not at full strength.

like it was above in the dungeon.  From the look of the skeleton laying

Before a Door~
A door is just a short distance to the east.  Even more noticable is
the large creature that appears to be guarding the door.  It might be
a good idea to turn around and run now if you are not ready for a good
fight.  If whomever is running this joint is putting a bouncer at the
front door, there has to be more foul evil behind it.

Front Door~
According to the nice engravings on the door, this door opens access
to the great 4 trainers of Rafermand.  Also according to the door only
the powerful my gain access to these trainers.  Well, it appears if
you are powerful enough you may continue on, but you will first need
to prove it to the door guard and get the key.

The Underground paths continue...~
The actual "entrance" into the underground is just to the west.  To
the north and the south two paths that most likely lead to the power
of the 4 trainers in this area.  That is if you don't get killed and
eaten by the nasty creatures here wishing to do you a lot of harm.

walls don't possess your undeniable power right?

Something was nice enough to leave a stack of bodies here for you to admire.
Looking more closely at the bodies you notice that the butcher has a rather
odd artistic style because the bodies are lined up forming the word DEATH.  How
nice of the citizens to leave you a friendly reminder.

A strange breeze wisps around in this room.  This would be nice if it wasn't
pushing all the horrible smells around and creating the horrible smell to
end all horrible smells.  You probably won't be able to eat food properly after
this experience, but when it comes to eating magic mushrooms there is not much
to enjoy (why can't it be magic chocolate?)

Blood appears to be pouring down into a small pond at this very spot.  Looking
down at the pond it appears to be man (err creature) made.  Something had enough
time to cut a nice hole in the ground here and trick some poor creatures around
here to bleed for their blood pond.  The creatures must be getting bored.

A bunch of skulls tied together by rope are hanging from the top of dugout walls
here.  According to every other hidious sighting in this place, not only are the
creatures here very barbaric, but they also have some strange artistic ability
too.  Perhaps you can talk with them.....yeah sure....

Something is horribly wrong with this room, it doesn't smell of death.  It might
be a good idea not to stay in this room for a very long time.  Then again, you could
choose to rest here, die, and start to create a foul smell for this room.  That
sounds like a grand plan right?

end up like the others, dead and stuck here.  We wouldn't want that would we?

Another beautiful room with blood splatters all over the ground and the dugout
walls.  If you stand around for too long and start to think about it, you might
end up like the others, dead and stuck here.  We wouldn't want that would we?

The screams seem to be increasing in volume here, almost as if they are coming
from the dreaded dugout walls themself.  If the walls are screaming to get out
of here, what does that say about your willingness to be here?  Then again these
walls don't possess your undeniable power right?

Blood appears to be pouring down into a small pond at this very spot.  Looking
down at the pond it appears to be man (err creature) made.  Something had enough
time to cut a nice hole in the ground here and trick some poor creatures around
here to bleed for their blood pond.  The creatures must be getting bored.

It appears some creature has left an ear sandwitch behind here.  A bunch of ears
from various races and odd creatures has been shoves in some bread looking 
material and was chewed on for a bit.  You know you want to go get you some of
that!

Something is horribly wrong with this room, it doesn't smell of death.  It might
be a good idea not to stay in this room for a very long time.  Then again, you could
choose to rest here, die, and start to create a foul smell for this room.  That
sounds like a grand plan right?

A bunch of skulls tied together by rope are hanging from the top of dugout walls
here.  According to every other hidious sighting in this place, not only are the
creatures here very barbaric, but they also have some strange artistic ability
too.  Perhaps you can talk with them.....yeah sure....

pushing all the horrible smells around and creating the horrible smell to
end all horrible smells.  You probably won't be able to eat food properly after
this experience, but when it comes to eating magic mushrooms there is not much
to enjoy (why can't it be magic chocolate?)

Something was nice enough to leave a stack of bodies here for you to admire.
Looking more closely at the bodies you notice that the butcher has a rather
odd artistic style because the bodies are lined up forming the word DEATH.  How
nice of the citizens to leave you a friendly reminder.

The light shines brightly from the sky, but looking closely you can see
that it is not a natural light, not even a good light.  The light is an
artificial light generated by something that can only be most evil.  Only
DEATH and PAIN is up here, hope you are ready for it.

False Impressions~
The evil light continues to shine all over offering a very erie feeling
along with an oddly soothing one.  The area in this upper floor appears
to be all artificial and consists of a grass like zone.  This would be
great out in the openness of the wilderness, instead it just adds to the
mystery of this horrible place.

quiet though and that silence can only be the kind that arrives before
the storm.  Hope your armor is nice and solid.

and it appears to be placed nice and cleanly on the other side of the

The path begins to wind here leading to something most foul toward the
southeast.  It can only be something big, nasty, and quite foul.  It
is a good idea to be ready for anything and everything because you will
soon be meeting face to face with it.

creates discussing their intentions toward something, hopefully they
have not found out that you are here.  From the sounds of it there are
quite a few of them and they are not here to share war stories.

From here you can see a giant door that is blocking entry into the rest
of this artificial slaughterfest.  The horrible sounds of below are starting
to increase the the foul smell is attacking like that 4th enemy that you can
never see.  The sounds of footsteps can be hard coming from around the door
along with a lot of grunting.

Before the giant door~
Just to the east the giant door that blocks entry into what can only be
another maze stands firm as anything you seen down below.  A giant creature
with big pointy teeth is also standing just as firm and stern as the door.
It looks like the only way through is to fight the creature, what else is
new right?

The door that allows access to the rest of the maze is directly in front
of you.  Also directly in front of you is the horrible creature that has
been placed here to prevent any further access into this horrible place.
In order to get in you are going to have to drop the big, nasty creature
and get the key from its rotting corpse.

Drops of blood drip from above, hell they even shine from the pristine light as
they drop to the ground.  Apparently the last poor individual here was watching
the dripping a little too much and didn't notice the creature that was there to
add his body to the large collection of its.  It might be a good idea to learn
from that poor soul's mistakes and leave this place quickly.

Giant spikes made out of bones of various races have been carefully planted in
the ground.  On top of them are future spikes to be made into an even larger
monument to the evil of this place.  The creatures here are very artistic in
their ways of dispatching their foes.

An odd quietness fills this area.  For a second it feels refreshing but it can
only mean something most foul and evil is waiting in the next room.  Now might
be a good time to get ready for it, but standing around for too long can only
mean certain death that or an interesting story...

The light shines down here and in an act of evil is shining a spot light on
the 6 dead bodies here.  Perhaps this evil place is trying to tell you a
little something, GET THE HELL OUT!!!  Well, you have made it this far and
leaving is not really an option now, is it?

The light seems to dim in the room leaving a very undesired affect of
spooking anything that enters the room.  A few shadows can be seen here
but just as soon as they are seen they disappear back out of site.  It
might be a good idea not to stay here for a very long time.

Screams can be heard coming from all directions even from above.  The
sounds sound like they are coming from some creature with a grasp of
the common language, instead of the devilish one that this foul minions
speak in.  The words are however barely recognizable due to what appears
a section of each of the poor soul's tongue being cut off.
A very beautiful message has been painted in blood on the wall.  The message
reads, "Anyone that continues will find a dagger in their back".  It is funny
because similiar messages have appeared all over down below and so far you
are breathing...well atleast for now that is.

reads, "Anyone that continues will find a dagger in their back".  It is funny
because similiar messages have appeared all over down below and so far you
are breathing...well atleast for now that is.

A very strange thing can be heard from here, the devilish creatures singing in
their foul language.  It is hard to understand what is going on, but by the
sounds of the screaming and what appears to be laughter and cheering, it appears
the creatures are having a fun time with some poor creature.

Drops of blood drip from above, hell they even shine from the pristine light as
they drop to the ground.  Apparently the last poor individual here was watching
the dripping a little too much and didn't notice the creature that was there to
add his body to the large collection of its.  It might be a good idea to learn
from that poor soul's mistakes and leave this place quickly.

Giant spikes made out of bones of various races have been carefully planted in
the ground.  On top of them are future spikes to be made into an even larger
monument to the evil of this place.  The creatures here are very artistic in
their ways of dispatching their foes.

An odd quietness fills this area.  For a second it feels refreshing but it can
only mean something most foul and evil is waiting in the next room.  Now might
be a good time to get ready for it, but standing around for too long can only
mean certain death that or an interesting story...

Screams can be heard coming from all directions even from above.  The
sounds sound like they are coming from some creature with a grasp of
the common language, instead of the devilish one that this foul minions
speak in.  The words are however barely recognizable due to what appears
a section of each of the poor soul's tongue being cut off.

A bunch of skulls tied together by rope are hanging from the top of dugout walls
here.  According to every other hidious sighting in this place, not only are the
creatures here very barbaric, but they also have some strange artistic ability
too.  Perhaps you can talk with them.....yeah sure....

Something is horribly wrong with this room, it doesn't smell of death.  It might
be a good idea not to stay in this room for a very long time.  Then again, you could
choose to rest here, die, and start to create a foul smell for this room.  That
sounds like a grand plan right?

The maze shows its face~
The maze can be seen now that the door is now behind you.  All sorts of
nasty sounds can be heard that was being muffled out by the door.  Also,
the smell appears to be even more putrid than it was before even more so
than it was down below.
