instazone will affect this area.  
 
To save changes permenantly, type "aassign none" and foldarea.
 
&rWarning&w!! Do not have an area aassigned to yourself when getting personal
vnums assigned to you.  The personal vnums will overwrite the area file.

area bestowed to you by a Greater God or higher.
 
In order to assign a nonproto area to yourself, you must either have
that area bestowed to you by an Exalted+. Even if you have the area bestowed
only Lesser+ can aassign themselves nonproto areas.

1 'ACID BLAST'~
#Magic Mage Offensive~
#END~
For a Novice looking to master the ways of the Earth Sphere, acid blast is a solid spell
for causing solid damage.  Acid blasts creates a large wad of acid and it is thrown
at the target causing an unfun burning to the skin of the target, and is even capable of
going through armor in some magical way.

1 'ACIDIC BALL'~
#Magic Mage Offensive~
#END~
A very similiar spell to Acid Blast.  When the spell was created, the creators decided to
add an acidic effect to armor to make it even more nasty.  Acidic ball conjuers up a large
ball of acid that flies towards its target and stays there causing moderate damage and
reaking havoc on the targets equipment at the same time.

Those who have made a good living learning and training the the earth sphere will get rewarded

a giant acid spike.  Once this spike is solid, it is sent toward the poor target causing large
amounts of damage to the target and his/her equipment.

on real time.  This will eventually be changed so it will affect all clock related
matters.

The parsing for time looks like this: 7:12:15:5

2 ADVANCEDEXITS~
#Immortal Building Exits~
#END~
SMAUG supports having more than one exit in the same direction, as well as
the special direction 'somewhere', represented by a '?'.
 
If you already have an exit leading north, and would like another one, use
a plus sign '+' in front of the direction:
  redit exit +n 3001          - Adds another exit north to room 3001
 
To modify an extra exit like this, or to remove it, you'll have to refer to
it by number:
  redit exit #2 3002          - Change the second exit to go to room 3002
  (to know what number an exit is, do an "rstat")
 
For someone to be able to use the second north exit, you have to set one of
the extra flags (see EXFLAGS) like CAN_CLIMB.  It's also usually a good idea
to set the HIDDEN flag for any special exit so that it looks nicer to those
with autoexits on.
 
The AUTO flag makes it possible to go in a direction by simply typing the
keyword for that exit:
  redit exit ? 3001           - Create a 'somewhere' exit to 3001
  redit exflags ? auto hidden - Set the proper flags
  redit exname ? swim         - Set the keyword "swim"
  ... here, if a player types 'swim' in the room they will move to room 3001

1 ADVICE~
#General Newbie~
#END~
Because you took the advice and read the helpfiles, here is some helpful
advice that will get you started in Rafermand.

1.  Read all the helpfiles that you can get when you type help.
2.  Keep about 3000 gold on you, use the rest to purchase ores and create slabs.  Get the
    best weapon you can get with the slabs you can get (if you happen to get 7, get a hammer)
3.  Use the remaining gold to purchase Studded Leather Armor from the leather shop.
4.  If you are a newbie to this mud, ogres are the easiest race to play.  They start out with more
    health and are resistant to damage and don't get sores as quickly.
5.  It is a good idea to fight the Sneaky thief in Level 2 of the Battle Grounds.  He has
    copper equipment and can be taken fairly easily if you follow the above guidelines.
6.  Once you get the copper equipment, you might want to break it or use it.
7.  Don't leave town till you are comfertable defeating Level 3 of the Battle Grounds.  If you
    are having problems in there, you might have problems outside too.
8.  Before you leave, make sure you have word of recall.  Other spells that are useful are cure
    light, armor, bless, and create food.
9.  Stay close to town on your first trip out of town, get use to the wilderness first and if you
    die, it will make it easier to retrieve your corpse.
10.  It is important to have enough money to purchase atleast a torch, so keep that money handy.

Syntax:  affected by    (abbreviation: af by)
 
'Affected' is a spells-at-a-glance function, which displays only the spells

listed by name only for the sake of brevity (if you want to know what each
is doing, use help <spell/skill name> or 'score').
 
Only way you can see the duration of an affect is to have the spell detect
magic casted on you.  Since elves inately have the ability to detect magic,
they can see how long an affect will last.
 
'Affected by' displays a character's affects separate from its spell/skill
affect list.  This is useful for ensuring that affects given from equipment
are actually functioning.  For example, if you are wearing a visor with
detect_invis but 'affected by' does not show you as having that affect, you
are not detecting invisibility.
 
'Affected by' also displays your current susceptibilities, resistances and
immunities if your character is level 20 or higher.

entered commands. Example: alias heal cast heal samson
This assigns the command 'cast heal samson' to the alias 'heal'
so that typing in 'heal' will issue the full command.
You can create up to 30 aliases.

Typing ALIAS with no arguments will list your current aliases.
Your aliases will save with your character upon leaving the game.
An alias may only contain a shortcut for a single command. If more

Blue - Your Kingdom
Red - A Kingdom you are at War with
Green - A kingdom you are Neutral toward
White - A kingdom you are Trading with
Orange - A kingdom you are at Peace with

AOC is generated by two things, the center of your town (showed as a T when
you use showcontrol) and the size of your town.  As the size of your town
grows, the AOC also will grow.  AOC is important for the following reasons.

1.  No other kingdom can start a town that will cut into your AOC
2.  Defensive units (Guards) get an extra advantage while fighting in
    your AOC
3.  Workers will dump back into your town if placed in your AOC
4.  It is the area of the map you can build in (help BUILD).  You can only

You can specify a level range to see a list of all areas with suggested
ranges which encompass the argument.  This can be a little awkward as
each area has a low and a high suggested range.  Suffice to say that if
an area's level range matches even one level of the range you request,

Syntax: armmilitary <unit/all> <leather/light/medium/heavy> <ore/none>
Syntax: armmilitary <unit/all> repair [appraise]

This is the command used to arm your military.  When you first purchase
a unit all it comes with is leather.  You can change this so the unit
is still using leather and gets a weapon or equip some actual armor
to the unit.  Each unit gets a specified weapon depending on the unit.
The size of the weapon and the type of armor is also affected by rather
use choose light/medium/heavy.  Light armor is typically the lightest of
the armor (chain) where the medium is the middle (ring/double ring) and
the heavy is the plate stuff.  Units already require a lot of time to
move, and putting on heavy armor drasticly affects this process even
more.  Below is the movement chart

UnMounted
----------------------------------------------
3 seconds   - Leather     3.5 seconds - Light
4.5 seconds - Medium      7 seconds   - Heavy

Some units get a bonus to unmounted and/or mounted movement, so there are
other factors besides those default ones.  In order to use the armmilitary
command you need both access to command and access the despository.  This
command can only be used at the barracks of a town.

Lastly, you can repair the units equipment if it get damages or goes missing.
It will cost you a certain amount of ore depending on the amount of armor that
is intact.  If 95 percent of your armor is not damaged, you will only pay for
that 5 percent.  The appraise option just gives you how much it would cost
without actually charging you for it.  The ore requirements are as such for
the race of your kingdom

the portal type 'enter' or 'enter portal' to pass through.  For more
details on portal, view the help file 'portals'.
 

Please note that astral will only work if the victim is in
the same area as you are in.  In addition to being able to target a 
victim, you can use these spells to go to any portal in the world you
have found.  For more info on portals view the help file 'portals'.

2 'BAN NEWBIE'~
#Immortal Punishment~

Banning a site is a form of last resort, as it not only affects the offending
player or players, but will also affect every other player from that site.
Before seeking to ban a site, even for a temporary level 1 banning, make
sure you have exhausted all other options first. 
 
In the case of newbie bans, most such instances arise through the actions of 
one or more abusive players who log in a newbie and begin swearing, spamming, 
threatening, etc.. Many times this has developed from an immature player's 
frustrations over getting a name authed. If you find a player going through a 
series of silly names trying to auth them, make every effort to try and talk 
with them first. If this fails, use Fquit to discourage them. If you have 
Disconnect, use this instead, as it is less provoking than fquit (makes it 
appear as if they simply lost their conneection). If they continue their 
efforts, send them warnings to get their attention. Use freeze if you have it 
(or if someone else is on who can use it) to get their attention and make sure 
received the message. Then, and only then, once you've exhausted all avenues
at being civil, you can use ban in good conscience. You've given the player(s)
every chance to cease their actions and given them fair warning over the fact
that if they continue they risk getting banned.

Syntax:  breakwall <direction>
Syntax:  repairwall <direction>

Walls are very useful for keeping people out of a certain area.  A wall in
the new system is considered a true wall or a door.  Doors are just capable
of closing/opening up the area and locking to keep unwanted guests out.  If
you find yourself unable to gain access to a locked door there is always the
bruteforce option of breaking the wall down.  Now, first you must understand
this action is considered an act of aggression and might be frowned upon if
you are caught.  Also, it takes a lot of weapon power to take down just one
wall, so either bring a bunch of spare weapons or a good friend to help you
hack down the wall.  Once you figure out that you want to break down the
wall, just use breakwall <direction> to start hacking down the wall.  Once
the wall gets damaged enough, it will turn colors so you can actual tell it
is about to break (help showascii for those colors).

Now, on the otherside of the equation, there is repairwall.  You can purchase
special hammers to repair the walls with buycaste.  These hammers will last
a certain amount of uses and will help to repair the wall.  It might actually
cheaper to break down the wall and rebuild it though, so that is something you
also might want to consider, but if you are trying to keep people out, sometimes
repairing is the best option.

The Build Fields are carpenter only commands.  You need to first set
your job to carpenter to use them (help SETJOB).  Once you are a 
carpenter, you can modify the name of the room, the sectortype of
the room, and the flags.  (help HOWTOBUILD) to get more information
over this process.  Lastly, you can only use these commands in your
AOC (Help AOC).

The Alter Fields are Terrain altering commands.  You can use these
commands to change terrain outside of your AOC.  These are commonly
used to alter the terrain around your kingdom so you can lay roads
or plant crops.  (help BUILD2) for more information over these options.

1 'BUILD RULES'~
#Kingdoms Creation~
#END~
There are certain rules about building when you are a player.  A few of 
them are inforced by code, some are not.  Breaking these rules will involve 
certain punishments pertaining to what rule was broke.  We are serious about 
these rules and all will be punished, even the innocent indirectly.  Well, 
without more rambling, here they are.

1.  You should keep the names of the rooms clean and try to avoid using
    obscene words or anything inappropriate.  If it is a road, mention that
    it is a road, etc.
    
The above rules are just fairly general rules.  The immortals reserve the
right to add or remove rules or reject descriptions based on current
needs.  Also, refunding of resources based on immortal changes is up to
the immortal, along with punishment for the kingdom/carpenters if they
choose to repeatively break the rules.

Placemob is used to place a mob that you bought.  It will take away the cost
of the unit (the full 4 month cost or 1 hour cost for workers) and put the
unit in the training queue for training.  (HELP TRAINING) for more information
over training and the training command.

Placeobj works like placemob, it will place an object at that location you are
in.  Placeobj works a little different than placemob on where you have to be.
Furniture items or any other items that can only be placed in kingdoms will only
work if you are in your kingdom, but other items like extraction equipment or
sigils can be placed anywhere.

Placetrainer is used to place a trainer in your kingdom.  The trainer has to
be placed in your kingdom and you can only have 2 trainers per room.

#Kingdoms Creation~

Carpenters are very important to a kingdom just as much as a builder is to
a developing mud (well carpenters help the mud also).  Anyway, carpenters
have the ability to take resources and build and reshape rooms.  Most of
their work resembles a builder on a typical mud, but the building is
much more restrained than the average builder.  However, carpenters are
rather free to build just about anything they want, but keep in mind, if
you want to waste a shitload of work by extractors to build a temple to
yourself, don't expect to be funded for your next project :-).

1 CARRYBIN~
#Kingdoms Creation~
#END~
Syntax: carrybin on/off
Syntax: carrybin <obj> <dir>

Carrybin is the command used to hall bins that can hold the different resources out in 
the wilderness (help EXTRACTION help EXTRACT). You first start off by buying one of the 4 
different sizes of bins available to kingdoms. There is a Small bin, a Medium bin, a 
Regular Bin, and a Giant bin. Small bins are meant to be able to be halled by an average 
strength player by him/herself full of only 1 resource type (bins can hold 2 types). The 
Medium bin is meant to take one extremely strong character (perhaps an ogre) or two 
average strength players to hall back. Medium bins can hold twice the amount of Smaller 
bins, but are mainly only an advantage to those who can carry them. The Regular bins work 
good as a central storing unit. It takes 2 to 3 people to hall the bin back full, but it 
is much easier to transfer goods from a regular size bin to a small bin (help 
GETRESOURCES). The Giant bins hold 5 times the amount of a regular bin and require 
anywhere from 5 to 10 people to hall back, so they aren't meant to be moveable, just a 
central spot to dump your resource into. 

Now that you know how bins work, to the command. In order to help someone move a bin, you 
must type CARRYBIN ON. Once your help has carrybin on, you can type CARRYBIN <OBJ> <DIR> 
to move the bin. You will either move the bin or it will tell you that you don't have 
enough strength in your group to move it. It is also possible that you might not have 
enough movement between your group, and when this happens only those who can move will 
move, and the bin will stay back if it wasn't moveable. It is important to turn carrybin 
off so thaty you don't get dragged into moving a bin against your will (or for the enemy) 

NOTE:  You don't use carrybin to dump a bin into a town anymore, this will be handled
by dumpgoods.

0 CAST~
#Magic~
#END~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

Caste is used to set the caste ranking of a player or set the number1 or number2 of a kingdom.
It is best to have the number1 or number2 in the room when you set them.  You can also remove
the number1 or number2 by just typing number1 or number2 without the name argument (again best
done if the player is in the room).  If you wish to set the caste, there are a few rules to
follow.....

1.  Those who do not own land (don't own a town) can only be set as high as Knight.
2.  Those owning land can only be set as high as Marquis

Public channels are those that can be seen by everyone, regardless of their
affiliation with clans, guilds, orders or councils.  Private channels are
channels available to those with affiliations of some sort, and also tells.

The first channels you will have as a new player are SAY, TELL, and NEWBIE.

 - to use say, the person you want to talk to must be in the same room,
   just type SAY <message>.
 - to use tell, the target person may be anywhere within the Realms, just
   type TELL <name or 0.name> [message].
 - newbiechat is seen and used only by level 1 characters, members of the
   Newbie Council, and Immortals.

Lastly, a new of channels are configurable using the color command.  Any
color you set will change the output of the text only.....So, if you

1 'CHARM' 'CHARM PERSON'~
#Magic Cleric Assisting~
#END~
The charm spell, if successful, will place the victim (only mobs, attempts
to charm other player-characters may incur the wrath of the gods) under
your control for the duration of the spell.  While under your control
the creature is your servant, and may assist you in combat and other
more minor duties.  Use the 'order' command to give them orders.
 
Be warned, you are responsible for the actions of your charmed beast.  If
it should go awry and take the life of another player-character, you will
be charged as a murderer and will be hunted by several creatures around
the Realms.
 
Aggressive mobs will lose their aggressiveness while charmed, but will
immediately return to their violent ways when the spell wears off.  For
this reason, charmed aggressive mobs should not be taken into any area
lower from the one from which they came, and should *never* be taken
into Rafermand or the Academy.  Those found doing so will pay dearly.
 
As a matter of etiquette, charmed mobs should not be attacked.  You can
tell a mob is charmed if it is wandering "in a dazed, zombie-like state."
Be aware when taking your charmed mobs around other characters that any
area attack such as call lightning, gas breath or earthquake will hit
your creature and cause it to engage in combat.

1 COMBAT~
#Combat~
#END~
Our combat system is slightly different than other muds, so it is important to understand
how it works.  First of all, the "attack" command is attack, kill and murder will still
work, but they point to attack.  In order to start a battle, you can either use a command
or spell that can be used to start a battle (try it to find out), or use the attack command.
The attack command syntax is as follows

Syntax: attack <mob> [target body]

In our system you can aim at certain body parts or limbs: head, rarm, larm, rleg, lleg, neck,
body.  If you do not supply a target, you will automatically aim at the body.  In addition, if
you have not used the target (HELP TARGET) command, you will not attack till you choose another
attack (Realtime).  In addition, each skill/spell/attack requires a certain amount of rounds
to pass before you can continue.  When it comes to attacking with weapons, the weapon size has
a lot to do with the speed you can attack, if you are wielding too heavy a weapon, it will take
you much longer to attack.  In addition, your movement (HELP ENDURANCE) effects your time along
with the amount of armor you have on your upper body (everything but legs, HELP EQUIPMENT).  For
more information over what targetting a limb does, see (HELP LIMBS).

While in battle, it might be important to change your grip (HELP GRIP).  You can use grip to
change to bash, stab, or bash.  Each one of these attacks has its own type of benefits and
downfalls (HELP GRIP), so it is important to use the right attack at the right time.

When you are fighting, you will notice we have slightly different battle output than most muds
do.  You can get more information over that by visiting the helpfile (HELP BDESC).

Lastly, for more detailed information over how the system works (HELP COMBAT2).  This
discusses more of how the system works (NOTE: This is the update for the new system for
2.1 so read if you haven't already)

1 COMBAT2~
#Combat~
#END~
This helpfile comtains information over the workings of the new combat system
and changes made.  Here is a quick rundown on the changes.

1.  The system is now based on a 30d system unlike before.  If you have equal
    weapons versus armor rating you roll against a 17.  However, each grip type
    (slash, bash, stab) will make a difference on what damage you do.  Bash has
    a 6 slide, slash 4, stab 2.  This means anything from 11 to 23 for bash will
    be a hit.  11 being the least amount of damage and 23 slightly below 100 percent
    damage.  A 17 will be 50 percent and then it goes down according to a percent
    value.  Slash being a slide of 4 would be 13 to 21.  Anything below these values
    are a miss, anything above is a hit.  This mainly means bash will land more often.
2.  A roll of 1 is a critical miss.  Critical misses either damage your weapon, add
    extra lag time to your fight, or just simply miss.
3.  A roll of 30 is a critical hit.  Critical hits are 2 to 3 times the amount of
    damage of a full hit.  In addition, shots to the head/neck/body can cause an
    instant death shot.  Some mobs and all undead are immune to these shots though.
    You will have the best chance to do an insta to head, then neck, then body.  Besides
    instas, you can do a critical limb strike with a slash or bash grip.  This will cause
    the limb to be cleanly removed.  Slash has the best chance to perform a crit limb.
4.  Aiming at anything but the body increasing the chance of the target dodging your
    attacking.  Aiming at the body actually decreases it.
5.  Races now have dodge mods.  Fairy has the best, Ogre the worst, etc.
6.  Changed how the "sore" rate and damage to limbs work.  The mob health you have the
    harder it will be to develop sores or get your limbs hacked off.  
7.  Armor/Weapon damage has changes since there is no percussion.  It is based on how
    much damage is dealt.  The more damage the more wear on the weapon/armor.

1 COMMAND~
#Kingdoms Military~
#END~
Syntax: command [mob/all/range] <dir>.
Syntax: command [mob/all/range] <x> <y>.
Syntax: command return [range].
Syntax: command town <townname>

A simple command that will allow you to command UP TO 10 kingdom mobiles.

You can either command a group of mobiles to move in a certain direction using
the normal movement commands (n, s, w, e, n+e, n+w, s+e, s+w).  You group them
together like this

2n5e3n+e5snnee

This kind of movement is considered "dumb" movement which means they will go
there till they hit the spot or are blocked by something.

The other kind of movement is the <x> <y> movement.  You specify a location
up to 70 rooms away from you in any direction and they will try to navigate
a route to get there.  If they cannot find one, they will tell you so.  This
option is "smart" since they will navigate around obsticles blocking them.  The
ranges are from your location.  -y is north, +y is south, +x is east, -x is west.
So -5 0 would be 5 west and 5 -4 would be 4ne 1e

command return has a range of 15 and will comand any units in that range to
return to your position.  This is again a "smart" movement, they will try
to get to you as best as they can.

command town <townname> allows you to sit at the center of your town and tell
all units in that room to move toward a town connected to your town.  This is
useful for moving a group of units quickly between two cities.

Comments should be used for all disciplinary actions and warnings, on anyone
who makes frequent demands of or troubles for immortals in general even if
the player is not doing something specifically illegal, repeated problems,
after _all_ reimbursements, and any other information you feel would be
important to another Immortal when dealing with the player in the future.

it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.

COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.

COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.

2 CONDUCT~
#Immortal ImmLaws~
#END~
.               &c&w**Rules of Conduct**
 
&G&W1.  Transfer command can be used on any immortal and will not check
    against level.  It is not kind to transfer an immortal for no cause.
 
2.  Giving of items with SPECIAL BONUSES are not allowed.  Exa.  Do not
    give a level 2 player a level 50 sword, or take a level 2 sword, and add
    10 hitroll to it.  I find this, you will be warned, then if it is abused,
    you will be demoted, or removed.
 
3.  For no reason should immortals be snooping players without consent of Staff
    rated immortals.  Immortals of lower level, however, lose this right, so
    don't be going off and doing stupid things that can be logged.  Use a
    mortal if you want to remain safer.
 
4.  Imms are allowed *1* immortal for use, unless authorized by Staff.  If you
    have the advance command, do not advance your player beyond 50 without
    consent.
 
5.  Secondly, imms with advance have the right to advance mortals for "testing"
    purposes only.  You can not play your mortal with other mortals if you are
    cheeting with it.
 
6.  Immortals are expected to attend atleast 5 hours each week, if you cannot
    do this, please inform Xerves so he knows what is going on.  Imms won't
    be removed because of personal problems, but will be if Xerves doesn't
    know.
 
7.  Cheeting with friends or any other player is not allowed.  The rules
    are the same for bonuses.  Cheeting would be using your imm to stop
    fights, or give repetitive restores and the such.  Everything needs
    to be fairly fair.
 
8.  As an immortal, you are help to a higher standard then a typical player.
    PLEASE, try to avoid getting into stupid arguments, or odd situations.
    This makes you look bad, along with the rest of the immortal Staff.  If you
    have a problem, handle it in a reasonable manner, or ask a higher level imm
    to help you rid of the problem.
 
9.  DO NOT, and I repeat DO NOT force players unless you absolutely must.  You
    want to lose players really quickly, that is one of the fastest ways I know
    on how to do it (this does not include forced saves before reboot, or
    punishments).
 
10. Your immortal is your immortal.  Any other login by another address, will
    be almost immediate termination.  If you want another person to login,
    please notify a staff level member, and they will make arrangements.

GET ALL <container> allows you to take everything from a container at once.
GET ALL.<item> <container> allows you to take all of a particular item type
 
PUT <item> <container> puts an item inside a container.
PUT ALL <container> will put as much of your inventory in the container as
possible, until the container is full.
PUT ALL.<item> <container> will put as much of one type of item into the

Copyover, also known as warmboot, is a process in which the mud will

true, but you won't see much difference).  Copyover typically provides
about five to ten seconds of lag and you will be able to enter commands
again.

When a copyover happens, you are saved and so is everyone else, but there
are a few things that aren't saved.

Groups
Fighting (if you are fighting you will stop)
Stuff that normally purges during reboots or crashes (like keys)
Stuff you might of dropped

Those are just a few things (there are probably more).  It is best to
get all your belongings or use anything that will disappear in a reboot
before a copyover happens.

Also, for immortals, it is important to savearea before one and loadarea 
once the warmboot is over because it doesn't save your area.

#General Information Credits~

Ooh this might get long, I have a lot of credits to mention in this little
old help file.  Anyway, I would first like to start out by thanking the
developers for DIKU, MERC, and SMAUG for releasing the code, in which I enjoy
dabbling in.  Second, I would like to give credit to the other 2 code bases
that I am familuar and have used ideas from, ROM and RoT.  Next, I need to
give credit to as much of the snippets that I have used, or any ideas from
other people I can remember (if you see something that belongs to you and
you are not listed on this list, please contact me, I lost some URLs to some
places)

As for other people.  I give out a huge THANKYOU to Wisdom from Call
of the Storm for helping me get the mud up and getting rid of some
pesky bugs before I even knew they exsisted (plus the wizhelp screen).
I would also like to thank Janus for getting me interested in doing
this way back before this ever started.  Also, thanks to Ghaleon/Stakk/
Octav/Qutius for being there in the beginning and telling me to switch
from RoT to SMAUG.  Also, thanks to Shai'tan for putting in a few
snippets.  Next, thanks to Remorhaz for coming up with some decent
ideas to put on the mud, and giving me a snippet to post on my page.
Lastly, but not the least, I would like to thank all the immortals
(builders/coders/skill makers/social makers/pests) that have helped
create what we have so far.  Without all of you, I would be doing
this all by myself.

CRITICAL STRIKE
Critical Strike is a very deadly skill in the hands of the skilled.
Being a skill favored by those trained in the arts and in theivery, 
critical strike will allow the user to strike at a very critical

it.  However, because the enemy moves around a lot, hitting the
target can prove to be quite a challenge.

#General Information~
#Combat~

When your character dies, you are reincarnated in the newbie camp or at
the recall spot of your Kingdom's choicing.  Your corpse is left behind
where you were killed, together with all of your equipment.  Your gold
stays with you (mysterious is it not?).

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death, and you lose
experience points as well.  Following/groups are not affected by death.
 
Corpses decay after time.  When this happens the objects inside a corpse
will decay with it.  Player corpses last roughly 30 minutes of real time.
Only the player who died or someone in their group can retrieve objects
from a player's corpse.

A "death trap" refers to the scenario where one steps into a room and is
immediately awakened from death with no equipment or corpse. A corpse
recovery is not an option in this case as there is no corpse to retrieve.
 
There are also pseudo death traps that may appear to be a dt, but leave a 
corpse or transfer a corpse to another area. This is not a true dt. 
 
It is often advisable to look before one leaps and heed room descriptions.
DT's do not warrant a reimbursement, they are a part of the game. Gold, 
glory and favor are not affected by a death trap.

Declare is used to declare war, peace, neutral, or trading on another
kingdom.  In order to move up on the peace status between two kingdoms,
both sides agree (so to go from neutral to trading, both sides need to
agree to trading).  However, to go down from neutral to war, all 1 side
needs to do is declare war.

Once one side declared something that needs to be accepted by both sides,
the other side can either reject it or remove it.  Both sides can see what
is being offered by using castevalues or offers and offered.

#Magic~

Syntax:  cast 'dispel magic' <character>
 
This spell dispels magical affects on the victim.  It may be used as an
offensive spell to remove an enemy's magical advantages, or as a benign
spell to completely remove your own magical affects.
 
If you are not a mage, you must be affected by the 'detect magic' to be
able to use this spell.  Though mages do not necessarily need to use it,
being under the affects of 'detect magic' will reveal more information
unavailable otherwise or to other classes.
 
'Dispel magic' can be used by players and mobiles alike against either
players or mobiles.  It cannot remove affects from equipment, your race
or your deity; some other affects are immune to this spell as well.
 
When a caster successfully casts 'dispel magic' on themself they will
remove all of their dispellable magical affects.  If a mage successfully
dispels a victim, the number of affects stripped will depend on their
success and intelligence.  Otherwise a successful cast of 'dispel magic'
on a victim will result in the removal of a single affect each time
(victims will notice when and what affects are stripped).
 
WARNING:  this is an offensive spell, and its use on anyone other than
yourself will be treated as an attack on your target.

0 DODGE~
#Combat Thievery Combatskills~
#END~
Dodge is a skill that works automatically while you are in battle.  You will notice
that you are either dodging attacks or not dodging attacks.  Along with it happening
automatically, there is a skill in the Thief sphere that will increase your chances
to dodge an attack.  By increasing this skill you can either dodge more affectively
or wear heavier armor, as will be explained next.

Dodge is affected by the armor size of your armor.  No armor is the lightest and yields
the best possible chance to dodge.  Next is leather, chain, ring, and plate.  A cuirass
and heaume have the highest value when it comes to armor size.  If you are weighted down
enough, you will not be able to dodge no matter what your stats are or your ability in
dodge.

Lastly, dexterity affect and shields.  By using dodge, you will either increase it for
using it, or decrease it for not using it.  If you wear light armor and dodge often, you
will increase both your dodge skill and dexterity.  If you are equiped like a tank, you
will start to lose dexterity over a period of time.  Lastly, if you are using a shield you
will suffer a percentage against your chance to block.  This percentage is your percent
to block an attack with a shield.  So if you have a 50 percent chance to dodge and a 50
percent chance to block with a shield, you will only get a 25 percent chance to dodge (50
percent of 50 percent is 25 percent).  Dodge does not affect your ability to block with
a shield.

1 'DUAL WIELD' DUALWIELD~
#Combat Warrior BattleSkills~
#END~
A very important skill for those who are looking to make a living learning the art
of fighting.  Dual wielding allows you to wield two, one-handed weapons or a weapon
and a one-handed projectile weapon (ex. crossbow).  You can then use both of these
weapons in battle.  If you are dual wielding normal weapons, you will notice less time
in battle to hit.  However, you will randomly attack with both weapons, so you don't
get a choice of which one to use (two maces work out well).  Only thing to remember is
you cannot dual wield two-handed weapons and you must have enough strength to wield both
of your weapons

(Note: It is important to remember you cannot wear a shield or use missile
       weapons when you wield two weapons)

0 DWARF~
#General Information Races~
#END~
----------------------------------------------BIO----------------------------------------------------
Dwarves, are heavily divided upon the world of Rafermand, their motives as diverse as each individual 
culture of their kind.  Some are nomadic traders, who often travel with a stockier, nomadic,
mercantile breed of beardless dwarves.  There are dwarves that have grown taller and thinner, tilling 
the land and living in dark, cold forests.  There are the people of the underground, some bitter, some 
reclusive, some nomadic (within cavern systems), and some whom have become bulky even for dwarves, 
stronger, meaner, and adept at being found only when they wish it, travelling unseen in the underearth 
using inherit, passive magicks.  Standing between dwarves and other cultures is wholly dependent on the 
individual collections of the dwarves, as they have a highly developed clan heirarchy.  Dwarven 
metalworks are highly sought after, and each breed of dwarf is known for crafting artifacts suiting their
general cultures.  Dwarven weaponsmiths are incredibly well known, but their arts are so refined, that a 
true dwarven master is almost as rare as any dragon or greater mortal.  However, only the darkest
of dwarves are skilled at creating powerful, prized weaponry, as the peaceful branches of dwarven society 
prefer the theory of swords to plowshares.

Drink instructs your character to drink from a fountain or a drink container
to alleviate thirst.
 
Eat instructs your character to eat an item of food or a magical pill (which
function in a similar fashion as potions); pills do not fill stomach space.
 
When you are hungry or thirsty (you will see messages at each tick that
tell you if you are starving or dying of thirst, and can check your
current state with either 'score' or 'oldscore'), you will not regain
hitpoints, movement points or mana back as rapidly as if you were well
fed and hydrated.
 
If you stay hungry or thirsty too long and you are not immortal, your
mental state will begin to suffer.  Your combat skills will be affected,
your coordination will suffer and you may begin to either hallucinate or
become depressed.  Eating, drinking and a little rest will solve this
problem after a short period of time.

2 ECONOMY~
#Immortal Building~
#END~
Each area will initialize (on bootup of the mud) with a pool of gold based
on the area's range and the wealth of each mob in that area.
 
The shopkeepers and thieves will automatically deposit gold into the economy
if they are carrying more than a certain amount (the higher the level of the
shopkeeper, the greater they will carry before depositing).
 
To allow mobprogs to be created to manipulate area economies, making them
interactive and interdependent, there are two mpcommands:  mpdeposit, and
mpwithdraw (see related helpfiles).  There is also an 'if economy' ifcheck.
 
The aset command can also be used to adjust an area's economy by hand
(example:  aset <area filename> low_economy <amount>, this will give
the specified area a minimum economy at the level you set).
 
Mobs will not repop with more gold than what they were originally created
with, but if the area economy runs low they will begin to repop with less
until the economy is replenished (as they all share the same gold pool).
 
Use foldarea to make changes to an area's economy with aset permenent.

1 'EDITOR FORMAT'~
#General Information~
#Immortal Building~

Syntax: /f [range] [width]

A very useful command when working with long paragraphs (particularly for
our builders).  What this will do is allow you to set any length on the
text you are typing, and when you are finished, just simply allow you to
format it to the typical length that is used in the mud (the stand is
to allow 640x480 see everything on the screen without line breaks).  So
once you are done, you will need to format your text, below is an example
and what it all means.

/f 1 5 75

Simply enough, this formats line 1 through line 5 to be spaced at 75 on
the right margin.  As of now, it will only space on the right margin and 75
is the standard for viewing.  Also, if you change around the range numbers
or make a number that doesn't exsist, it shouldn't work (but it won't crash
the mud either).

#General Information~
#Magic~
#Skills~
#END~
Elements are the elments you choose at the beginning.  There are 6 basic elements used in
Rafermand: fire, earth, water, air, energy, divine.  When you choose an element in the beginning
you are mainly choosing which element you can obtain Tier 4 spells in (help tier).  A Tier 4
spell is the strongest spell available in that group or element.  These spells are very powerful
and can only be obtained by the skilled veteran players of this game (so if you are a newbie you
have awhile to go).  In order to obtain such a spell you will first need Tier 3 spells up to
Master status, a book for your Tier 4 spell (which is not the easiest thing to obtain) and a trainer
to teach you this Tier 4 spell.

There might be other things that your element might affect later (such examples as limiting an opposing
element Fire:Water Earth:Air Energy:Divine) and making you resistant to your own element.  However, none
of this is implemented atm, so look back to his helpfile later if any changes are made.  For more
information over the elements see (help MAGIC)

much harder, they channeled all their energy and even their soul into
the land to curse it with the magical powers of the elements.  Shortly
after, they died from the experience and the elemental canyon was born.
Because of the problems this would cause with the creatures getting
loose, the citizens of Rafermand quickly close off the area.  Not much
else is known about the area.

0 ELF~
#General Information Races~
#END~
----------------------------------------------BIO----------------------------------------------------
Elves, an enlightened, magical race.  Elves, though advanced in almost all aspects of civilization, 
are reclusive by nature, and in the world of Rafermand, they are highly shunned both for
their prowess in the arcane and their spiritual beliefs, their beliefs even during the Time Before The 
Gods that something greater than mortal guided the fate of the world.  The arrival of new deities has 
disrupted power amongst the elven spiritual heirarchies, and internal turmoils prevent elves from 
actively engaging in outside relations, so over the years, in some areas, elves slowly became the thing 
of myths, even though some of their kind are known to wander and engage in relations with the other 
races.  Another factor contributing to the outcast nature of the elves is that outsiders are forbidden 
from stepping foot within the great, living citadels of the elves, citadels hidden from all but the 
greatest of prying eyes.  Racially, any of the 'darker races' are shunned by elves.  Any elven colony 
which tries to maintain outside political affilations is outcast from even elven society, and the 
practitioners of the darkest of elven arts find that few, even the greatest of evils, will trust or 
accept them.  The rare individuals that practice these forbidden, immortal magics never coexist with 
others like them, and as such, are incredibly rare, and shortlived, when they are discovered.

Our equipment system is also slightly different than other systems.  We have 5
"key" armor slots: head, arms, legs, chest, neck.  There are other slots, but
they are mainly for holding bags, sheathes, and robes.  They possess little to
no advantage in protection.  The other 5 slots are used to defend against attacks
to the limbs they cover (HELP LIMBS HELP COMBAT).  It is important to have neck
and head gear because a landed blow there can be lethal and cause death with only
one hit, no matter how little damage it does.  Each piece of armor has a defense
rating for bash, slash, stab (HELP GRIP).  The better the ore and the bigger the
piece of armor, the more protection it covers for that area.  Also, neck and head
gear seems to do a better job than the others protecting their areas (HELP FORGEARMORS)

When it comes to weapons, each weapon can be used to bash, slash, stab (help GRIP),
but each weapons typically tends to be better at one than the others (HELP FORGEWEAPONS).
In order to change which one you are attacking with, you would use the (grip) command
to change how you are gripping the weapon to strike with.  This is important if you
enemy has special armor that is strong in a certain area, or you want to switch to
a certain type during a battle.  Switching grip takes a few seconds in battle (HELP

The 'redit exit' command is used to create, modify and remove exits in a room.
Currently there can only be one exit in a certain direction.
The syntax of the 'redit exit' command is as follows:
redit exit <direction> [vnum] [exit-type] [key] [keyword(s)]
direction: one of: n, s, e, w, u, d, ne, nw, se, sw or ?
vnum     : the room number in which the exit leads to.
exit-type: a number detailing the exit -- has a door, open/closed/locked etc.
key      : a number corresponding to a key object which can unlock the door.
keywords : keywords used to refer to the door, (or exit).

If only 'redit exit <direction>' is specified, the exit will be removed.
The 'key' field is optional when specifying keywords.  All other fields are
required previous to the field desired.

Examples:
redit exit n 3001           - Creates an exit north to room 3001
redit exit n 3001 3 gate    - Changes the exit north to have a closed "gate"
redit exit n 3001 3 15 gate - Changes the gate to allow use of a key vnum 15

#Kingdoms Creation~
#END~
Extracting goods from the lands is not a skilled job, but one that does
require special equipment.  In order to extract from the lands, an
individual needs to be appointed a worker by a member of the kingdom that
has the ability to appoint (minappoint).  After that, they need to purchase 
equipment in which to extract the lands.  Certain equipment is better than 
other equipment, so either pay a nice price for the good stuff, or just take 
your time with the poor stuff.

Once you start extracting, you are able to hold a certain amount of material
on you.  The amount is influenced by your strength, so an ogre or
another strong class makes good workers.  Once you are full or tired of
extracting, it is possible to drop the goods off into a resource bin.
Also, it is possible to completely extract all goods from one spot.  After
that, you will have to wait quite awhile till it regenerated enough material
to be useful again.

can only extract one thing at a time, however, they can either change it
themselves if they have the proper caste or ask someone who can.  The below
is the types of extractable material

Gold (Value 1)
----
A very valuable raw material that is used to purchase unique things in the
kingdom.  Not to be confused with gold coins though.  

Iron (Value 2)
----
The basics for producing large equipment that requires a harder material than
wood or stone.  Iron cannot be used to make iron ore or slabs that players
can use to make equipment...

Corn (Value 3)
----
A basic food item that can be used to feed people with or trade.

Grain (Value 4)
-----
Another basic food item that can be used to feed or trade with.

Lumber (Value 5)
------
Very valuable to Carpenters, needed to build just about everything in the
cities of the Kingdom.  A very important material in allowing a kingdom to
grow.

Stone (Value 6)
------
A slightly harder material than Lumber, but not as durable as iron.  Stone is
used to pave roads and paths, make walls, and other various objects that might
be needed by the kingdom.  Stone is a natural product of the world and cannot
be grown like corn, grain, and lumber

0 'EXTRADIMENSIONAL PORTAL' 'EXTRADIMENSIONAL'~
#Magic Mage Defensive~
#END~
One of the newly born spells that was brought to the world when Xerves first
made his presence known.  It was becoming a problem with a few of his underlings
not being able to carry the material, equipment, and the loot that he/she needed.
So in response to this need, Xerves crafted one of the few new spells in the
world, extradimensional portal.

The extradimensional portal takes a great time and care to master because the
first portals created by a master wizard are quick small in size and cannot hold
much more than a paper sack.  But the patience of the wizard will be rewarded in
the future with the ability to easily hold more loot than any other ways possible.
The people who possess this spell are said to be under Xerves's constant watching
and are very reluncant to share their magical power with any who are not deemed
ready under Xerves's eye.

0 FAIRY~
#General Information Races~
#END~
----------------------------------------------BIO----------------------------------------------------
Faeries, perhaps the most diverse of all the races, probably most resemble the humans in idealogy.  
Faeries are incredibly diverse, and they are incredibly chaotic, with very impulsive, fluid
political affiliations.  A sacred pact with a fairie is about as credible as a verbal agreement with a 
drunken ogre, as such pacts are oft forgotten seconds after they have been made.  Most fairies
are incredibly gifted at a natural magic, harnessing spells and invocations inaccessible to any other 
race...yet few use their power for more than the continued growth of their hidden cities.  Faeries are 
the most diverse of all races in physical appearances, ranging from the cherebum-like images most 
rumours within Rafermand detail, to the dangerous, wingless faeries possessing great thorns in place 
of wingbones.  There are races of faeries that are not wholesome by nature, but all faeries share a 
common realm, serving one royalty alone, and as such, rarely share totally opposing external relations.  
Mistrusted by all larger races as a general rule due to their finicky nature, it is hard for a faerie to 
form friendships between any others.  As a general rule, the collective motive of the faeries is simply 
assumed to be the preservation of their secret, secluded realm.  There are tales of a village where 
outcast faeries, and their sylvan counterparts, the elves, coexist...but such a place would be guarded 
almost as closely as one of the great living citadels of the elves, or the secret home of the faerie 
people.

1 FAME~
#General Roleplaying~
#END~
Fame system is part of the introduction system.  Fame is a number formulated
by how famous you are.  How do we measure this, well it is a secret.  You don't
know your own fame, but as you spend more time online and do more famous things,
you will become noticed and people will start to learn your name.  This can either
be a good or bad thing.  If you are a thief and you become famous, well, that is
not a good idea if you are trying to be all stealth like.  The best away to avoid
being famous of course is remain hidden to everyone by using a cloak and hiding
your face.

Once you reach a certain point of fame, people will know you by your lastname.  After
another value, people will know you by first name and last name.

1 FANS PK PKILL~
#Combat~
#END~
The FANS PK System (developed by Rook, Nevon, and Ely and coded by Xerves)
FANS (Full-loot/An Item/No-loot/Safe-from PK System)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are some of the Player Killing Zones?

   Some zones will not be PK and some will. There is not an exact list of which zones have
   PK portions in them, but by word of mouth and notes posted to boards you, the player, will
   find out quickly. If you enter a full-loot area then you will know right away when you enter
   that section.

What is FPK (Full-looting Player Kill)?

   FPK is a lawless zone: none of the laws in regards to conduct apply in FPK:
   you can harass, swear, taunt, spam, whatever suits your fancy. However, the
   connections rules regarding multiple characters are still in affect in FPK; meaning:
   you have multiple PCs in an FPK zone, you will be dealt with severly.
   FPK is full looting (all of your eq and the gold on your person will be in your corpse)
   meaning anything on your corpse when you die (NOT necessarily PK'd) can be looted.
   Entering FPK is a voluntary action requiring player acknowledgement: complaints
   will fall on deaf ears.  No PK or looting of your clan members or your group members
   will be tolerated while in FPK.  In FPK, you will gain XP for PKills and will
   lose XP from PDeaths.  However, conspiring to FPK someone with their consent for
   XP _IS_ against the rules.  There are no reimbursements, no CRs, no immortal help at
   all will be given to those in FPK.  If an immortal breaks this rule, please report it
   to a Staff Immortal (caste Staff or Admin, lv71+).  Repeated violations of these rules
   will result in the Immortals having a field day with your pfile.

What is APK (An Item Player Kill)?

   An Item is for players who cannot jump all the way into the realm of losing it all
   upon death.  An item zones, when you die, only one item will be removed from your
   corpse when you die.  This item, upon death, will fall from your corpse to the
   ground and *IS LOOTABLE* by anyone in the game.  So, your killer has to grab the
   item quickly before some other individual takes his/her prize.  The items that
   are selection to fall from your corpse are the items you are equiped with, so
   be careful.  The same rules involving player connections and taunting do apply
   in APK areas, and experience is given per kill.  Finally, just like FPK areas, you
   will be warned with a nice message before you enter an APK zone.

What is NPK (No-looting Player Kill)?

   NPK is a PK environment with restrictions.  The laws of Rafermand are in an NPK
   zone(no taunting, harassment, etc.).  There is also no looting in NPK; a corpse
   in NPK is to be a left a corpse in NPK: no removal/addition of objects.
   Also, in NPK, initiating PK with someone in a fight with a mob is against the
   rules; also against the rules is to help or hinder this mob in any way
   (assuming of course you are not formed with the person in question).
   No camping in NPK will be allowed (HELP CAMPING). In NPK, XP is _NOT_ gained from 
   PKills and XP is _NOT_ lost from PDeaths. There will be NO mob-stealing/kill-stealing. 
   Kill stealing is attacking a mob when another player is engaged in combat with the mob.

What is SPK (Safe-from Player Kill)?

   Basically SPK is that: no PK actions or violations of the Rafermand Laws will be tolerated.
   Also, banking (HELP BANKING) is not permitted in SPK, unlike NPK or FPK. Also in SPK, like
   NPK, no mob stealing or assistance/hinderance of mobs fighting PC's will be tolerated without
   said PC's permission.  However, just because it is a safe zone, it is not safe for everyone.
   Individuals marked "Thief" or "Killer" are safe nowhere, and may be attacked in a safe
   area.  In addition, law inforcement of a local area have the right to attack in a safe
   zone.  Lastly, it is possible to shove a person out of a safe room if you move quickly.

1 FEAR~
#General Information Credits~
#END~
FeAr stands for Forming Everyone's Addictive Reality. It is the name of 
the current version of the code base we are using now. We are still a 
SMAUG derivative mud, but we feel we are making steady ground to being 
something much more differently than a normal SMAUG mud, or a normal any 
kind of mud at that. 

If you are asking that we are giving out our code know because we have 
named it, the answer is no. I have done a lot of work to get this mud to 
the point it is now and do not plan on giving away my work at this moment. 
I might consider it later, but please do not ask me. 

Lastly, I don't mean this in any disrespect to the SMAUG creators or 
anything, but just simply pointing out that we are much more different 
than that now. So thanks for all who have distrubuted code and helped form 
what this mud is today and please look at the credits for some of that 
info.

it is just put it in and see if it works. Only tip I can provide is to remember it gives

Projectiles are wielded weapons which allow players to hit victims
without being in teh same room.  Projectiles have a few forms in Rafermand
and those include: bows, crossbows, and slings.  Each type has their own
ammo (arrows, bolts, stones) and each kind typically has their advantage
and disadvantage.

In order to fire a missile weapon, you need to be wielding that weapon in
the 'missile wielded' slot.  You can do this by just wearing the weapon or
typing 'wield <weaponname> missile'.  These weapons will only work in this
slot.

In order to actually fire the projectile (arrow, bolt, stone) you need to
be holding it in your hand, so you guessed it, you cannot dual wield while
you are firing, so you might consider wearing a sheath if you want to use
your missile weapon.  Once you have your hand open, you can either put an
arrow in it, or you the nock command to draw and nock the projectile for
your weapon.  Then you can use the fire command to fire at a target.

In addition to all of that, you also have a few firing options.  You can use
the aim command (help aim) before you fire, fire directly at a target in the
same room, fire in a certain direction (which will hit the first mob or player
in that direction), or just the normal fire <dir> <target> command.

Lastly, remember that you can fire at both players and mobiles, so be careful in
what you choose, you could accidently hit a player and it is considered a pkill
attempt.  Illegal pkill is not tollerated and you should stop immediately and
contact an immortal, if it is legal, shoot away.

When you are firing in the wilderness, there are a few things you need
to be aware of.

Since the wilderness is more 2d than regular areas, you will find
yourself needing to shot ne, sw, etc.  Use aim to target an enemy and
use fire target to shoot at that enemy.  Typing aim without a target
will pick up the closest mob.

If you fire your weapon and it is not long enough, it will fall to
the ground just before your target.  If you are aiming, you will not
fire the weapon, so again, aiming is the better idea.

1 FIX~
#Combat~
#General Objects~
#END~
Syntax:  fix <item needing repaired> <item which to do the repairing>

Fix is the command used to repair damaged armor, weapons, and sheaths.  Fix
can only be used on damage items and cannot actually put back together something
that is broken.  In order to use fix you first need to have the item you want
to repair in your inventory and an item to repair it with.  The most typical
items are repair hammers, which are sold in Rolen Camp at the Bare Essentials
shop.  Once you have your hammer and the item you want to repair, you use the
fix command to start repairing it.  It might take a few times before it starts
to repair, so keep using it till you get to a point that it is ok.

Using fix is rather expensive and unless you have tons of cash to spend on repair
items, it is best to take it to a blacksmith and get it repaired there.  To cut
down costs, there is the repair skill (Warrior sphere) that will increase your
chances of repairing an item.  The skill will increase after repairing weapons/armor.

There are 19 ores in the game (for a list help FORGEORES) and each ore can be used to make the
80 or so weapons/armor capable of being created (HELP FORGEWEAPONS  HELP FORGEARMOR).  All you
need to do is goto a forge with some ore and charcoal, or slabs.  You can find or buy ore in the
game and you can typically find charcoal being sold at an ore shop.  Once you get the right
materials, all you do is goto the forge and use the forge command

Syntax: forge slab <ore #>

Syntax: forge list [type] (to see a list of forgeable types)
Syntax: forge ores (to see a list of ore slabs that can be done here.
Syntax: forge appraise <weapon/armor name>
Syntax: forge sell <ore #> <number>

* Use (forge slab) to create a slab, you must have the ore and charcoal in your inventory
* Use (forge create) to create a weapon/armor.  Type (forge list) and (forge ores) to get
  the ore and weapon number
* Use (forge break) to break an already forged item down into slabs
* Use (forge list) to see a list of items, can put in an optional type (ex: head)
* Use (forge ores) to see a list of ores
* Use (forge appraise) to see how much ore an item will break down into
* Use (forge sell) to sell slabs you don't want.  They are bought at 1/10 of sell price

1 'FRIGID BALL'~
#Magic Mage Offensive~
#END~
A very fierce spell in the arsenol of the Water Mage, Frigid ball can be as deadly as
it can come.  An experience Water Mage can conquer a huge Ball of Water and can power
it up to the point where it is so cold it will freeze anything that it comes into
contact.  Once this ball is created, it is thrown at a target or two and causes massive
amounts of damage.  A very frigid death can only be waiting for such targets.

As a Water Mage masters the art of his/her sphere, the powerful spell of Frigid Death is

fall to their knees or simply fall over dead.  Not many can say they survived after being
hit by this spell by a master of the art.

As those who wish to master the Water Sphere advance in power, the next spell of massive

another of ice, which like cold ball is hurled at the target and anything close to it.  Those
who master this spell are said to be able to hurle the ball at amazing speeds at the targets
and cause massive amount of damage to many targets.

One of the first spells learned in the water sphere is the simple spell of frozen dart.  The
newbie sorcerer want-to-be will start out by conquering small darts of ice and then targetting
their enemy or some inanimate object and hurling them at the target.  The darts cause light
damage, but can be useful against small creatures.

hurl those instead of darts.  The spikes are much more capable of doing damage, and can be
used to take down larger beasts or men.

damage, but the more experienced mage can create large funnels that can do a great deal

2 FURNITURE~
#Immortal Building BuildingObjs~
#END~
It is now possible to sit/sleep/rest/stand on furniture, as well as
assign the furniture to recover mana/hp/movement for a player who is
on the furniture.  Here is how all of this works.

value0 - Max Number of people on obj (default 1)
value1 - Max weight an object can take before breaking (default 750) 
value2 - sit/sleep/rest/stand on furniture (more below)
value3 - Percent of health/move is gained by furniture (100 is times 1)
value4 - Percent of mana is gained by furniture (100 is times 1)
         **Default is if the value is 0 and default for v3 and v4 is 100** 
As for value2, it uses bitvictors, and here are their numbers

&G&WSIT ON -    1        SIT IN -    2        SIT AT -    4
STAND ON -  8        STAND IN -  16       STAND AT -  32
SLEEP ON -  64       SLEEP IN -  128      SLEEP AT -  256
REST ON -   512      REST IN -   1024     REST AT -   2048
&g
To make those work, you add the numbers together, say you want
to be able to sit on, stand on, sleep on, and rest on the object,
you then would add the numbers together and put in value2, 585.

Also, you can only select an on/in/at option on the actions.  This
means you cannot select sit on and sit at for one piece of furniture.
If you do this, it will only be sit at.

Lastly, you can examine a piece of furniture to get an idea of its
stats.  Very useful!

Rafermand supports furniture options.  You can now use the commands
to sit/sleep/rest/stand on/in/at furniture.  Also, the code supports
healing modifiers on the furniture, along with max amounts of people
and weight the furniture can hold (if the weight is exceeded, it breaks
and everyone falls off).  All you need to do is find a piece of
furniture that is working correctly.

What is the world when you don't have a place to bet all of your money?
Well, gambling mobs allow you to do such things.  As of right now,
Dec 7, 1999, you can only play mobs, but if this becomes more popular, I
might add in support for playing other players.  Also, only a few games
are in right now, but I am sure more and more will be added later.  Also,
a mob is only skilled at playing one game, so if you want to play multiple
games, you will probably have to walk around and play elsewhere.  Lastly,
only one player can play at a time.

It is important to remember that the boards are for ***GLOBAL*** matters.
If the message isn't for everyone in the mud or a reply back to a general
note, it should probably be left off the public boards.  Anything you
have for the immortals should be posted to these boards because they
are the only ones we read regularly.

Note: Personal matters are to be left to the ingame boards and should be
left off the gboards unless they deal with one of the boards listed or

1 GETRESOURCES~
#Kingdoms Creation~
#END~
Syntax:  getresources <bin> <type> <amount> [target bin]

Getresources is the main command to get resources from bin, or move it bin from bin (HELP CARRYBIN).
Bins are mainly used to hold resources, and the smallest ones are used to transport it back to the
kingdom.  You can also transport the resources by hand instead of by a bin, but this is a much slower
process because players can only have 70 to 110 or so resources per trip, where a small bin can hold
2500 resources.  In order to get resources from a bin to carry, you would type something like this:

  getresources medium 5 all (HELP EXTRACTION for type value)
  getresources medium 5 50
  
You can either use all for the <amount> (saves the thinking, the code will do that for you) or if you
just want a specific amount, you can specify a value.  For the <type> you will need to use the values
and you can find them at (HELP EXTRACTION).  This will transfer lumber (wood) to your character and you
can them use dumpgoods back in your town (HELP DUMPGOODS).  To move resources from bin to bin, you would
do something like this

  getresources medium 5 all small
  getresources medium 5 1950 small
  
Again, it is best to use all unless you need a specific amount.  All will check the amount in medium and
the amount small has left and take the maximum amount.  Once you have the correct resources in the right
bins, you can use carrybin (HELP CARRYBIN) to move it back to your town.  (NOTE:  Sometimes you might be
moving from like bins, 1.bin is the last bin listed, 2.bin is second to last bin listed, etc)

orders - stationary patrol warn attacke attackn attacka nopass report invite noassist.

Giveorders is the command that you use to control the military mobs and what
actions they will perform.  It is important to set the orders you want so

to your kingdom (range is 10)

Attacke, Attackn, and Attacka are actually used to attack roaming mobs
that belong to other kingdoms.  E stands for Enemy Status, N stands for
Neutral Status, and A stands for All.  Meaning, if will attack ANY member
of any kingdom that meets that ranking or below it.  All will simply attack
any non-kingdom member.

nopass  report(Report is not in use as of yet)
-------
nopass will not let any non-kingdom member pass.  It will ask the individual
to go back in the direction he/she came from, if not, he/she will be attacked
If he/she is a mob, he/she will be attacked on sight.

invite [range]  noassist
-------
Invite will invite one kingdom mob at a time to assist in battle.  This
mob will come to assist unless it has noassist setup.

conquer
-------
Mobs that are set to conquer will start to conquer a town.  It takes 3 days to
conquer a town.

nocloak nohood attackh attackc needintro
-------
nocloak, nohood, and needintro are nopass like commands to not let anyone pass
that has a cloak on, has a hood on, or is unknown to the kingdom (respectively).
Attackh and Attackc (hood and cloak) will attack any player with a hood or cloak

These commands are used with the new global board system.  The boards are
OLC boards in Rafermand and commonly have important notes to read.  Please
only use these boards for what they are attended for.

Changing between the boards is accomplished using the GBOARD command.  To change, 
type GBOARD <number> or GBOARD <name of the board>.

To read a note with a specified number, type GNOTE READ <number>. Note that 
unlike the standard note system, a note has the same number in GNOTE LIST and 
GNOTE READ.

Posting a message is as simple as writing GNOTE WRITE. You will be moved
into interactive mode, where all you see are prompts for the fields like
To:, From: etc. You will be automatically put AFK while writing a note.

To see the list of the notes in the current board, type GNOTE LIST. Typing
GNOTE LIST <number> will list only <number> of the last notes in the area.

You can remove your own note by using GNOTE REMOVE <number>. Implementors may
remove other people's notes. Implementors can also select how many days
their note is kept before being purged. 

To let only immortals see your note, address it to "imm". To let players of
a specific level and above, address it to that level (no other recipients may
appear in that case).

This board system was created by Erwin S. Andreasen, erwin@pip.dknet.dk, aka

1 GRIP~
#Combat~
#Combat Warrior BattleSkills~
#END~
Grip is both a command and an automatic skill.

The skill is automatic, once practiced.  The skill causes you to grip
your weapon tightly as someone tries to disarm you, making it far more
difficult to successfully disarm you.  This skill will only increase as
you are engaged in fights where someone is attempting to disarm you.

As for the command, it is used to switch between bash, slash, and stab while
in battle (HELP COMBAT).  Each one of these types of attacks have their
advantages/disadvantages, and they are as follows.

Bash - Typically armor has the highest rating for this attack, meaning it
doesn't land as much.  However, it can do percussion damage.  This damage
is not as much as landing a blow, but it will do a little bit of damage
every time, also damaging armor and the limb.  (NOTE:  Percussion damage
cannot do a deadly blow to the neck/head).

Slash - A balanced attack, the armor value for slash is typically lower than
bash and the damage from slash is a bit more than bash.  Slash can cause a
little bit of percussion damage, but it is mainly used to land blows.

Stab - Stabbing weapons are capable of doing the most damage and taking down
an enemy is a carefully landed blow.  Stab does not do any percussion damage,
but sometimes it penetrates armor and lands blows or kills the target.  Typically
the choice of assassins and those who want the battle to go quickly.

the GTELL and SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will
automatically join the fight.
 
If character is already a member of your group, 'group <character>' again to
remove them from your party.  Removing the character from the group does not
stop them from following you, however.  A character can also leave a group
by using the 'follow self' command, in which case they will both leave your
group and stop following you.
 
'Group' with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.
 
'Group all' groups all eligible players following you in the room.
 
'Group disband' allows the leader to disband his group (members will stop
following and are ungrouped).

grub 20 pkill=y class=5      Display 20 Druid pkillers
grub 20 level=2 last<=970120 Display 20 L2 players absent since 970120
grub 20 level>=20 level<=30  Display 20 players levels 20 thru 30
grub  0 level=2              Count the number of level 2 players
grub 20 level>50 gold>100000 Display 20 imms with more than 100k gold
grub 50 damroll>100 sex=2    Display 50 females with damroll>150
grub  0 class=5 damroll>150  Count the number of druids with damroll>100
grub 20 site<>123.456.789    Display 20 players from site 123.456.789
grub 10 class=0 race=2       Display 10 dwarven mages
grub  1 name=Joe             Display Joe's info
grub 20 room=7070 class=0    Display 20 mages who logged off in 7070
grub  0 class!=2 class!=3 class!=4   Count the number of mana users
 
You always need to specify the number of lines you want displayed. The
reason for that is that we don't want to ask for a list and then get
surprised to find that it's 15,000 lines long. You can get a count
of the players that match your criteria by requesting zero lines.
 
GRUB will tell you how many lines there are in the list no matter how
many you ask to display. So if there are 15,000 players that meet your
criteria and you ask for the first ten, GRUB will tell you there are
15,000 in total but will only show you the first ten.

2 'GRUB EXAMPLES'~
#Immortal Building~
#END~
Here are some examples illustrating common usages:
 
Example:
 
grub 20 or hitroll>150 damroll>150 gold>200000000
 
Suppose you want to search for "suspicious players". Suppose you want
to see players who have more than 200 million gold or whose damroll
exceeds 150 or whose hitroll exceeds 150 you can do that as follows:
 
Normally GRUB lists players who satisfy all the conditions you specify.
But it can also be used like this to list players who satisfy any one of
the conditions.
 
The operand "or" ensures GRUB will list players who satisfy any one of
the conditions.
 
If you had specified:
 
grub 20 hitroll>150 damroll>150 gold>200000000
 
That would show you players whose hitroll exceeds 150 and whose damroll
exceeds 150 and whose gold exceeds 200 million. It would be a much
smaller list and you would miss many suspicous players.
 
Example:
 
grub 20 name>ska name<skb room>=21000 room<=21499
 
Suppose someone complains that a player with a name like "Skathamaga"
picked up some of their eq and promptly quit the game. The player isn't
sure of the exact name of the thief but is sure it starts with "Ska".
The thief quit the game somewhere in New Rafermand (vnums 21000-21499).
 
This example will show you players whose name starts with "Ska" and who
last quit the mud somewhere in New Rafermand.

into oblivion.  It was so fast and so sudden that it appeared his friend was there one
second and then gone the next.  The sorcerer could never duplicate the pure strength of
what happened before, but was able to create a spell that causes a mysterious power to
simply appear from the heavens and blast the living hell out of a target.  Heavenly Blast
is the strongest of all Tier 4 spells.

note of:
&Y
    1) At the very least, the first character of a help file cannot be
       either the symbol '&&' or the symbol '^^'.
    2) Color changes have to be separated by at least one character. ie,
       '&&Y.^^r' will work, '&&Y^^r' will cause problems. 
    3) Color codes are imbedded within text and _do_ count in note buffers
       for line length. ie, watch out for <Long Line Trimmed>.
&w
Colors should be used to &Yenhance &wthe help file, or specific parts of the

Syntax:  hide

Hide is used to stay hidden from players and creatures that cannot detect hidden.
In order to stay hidden, you have to remain silent though, so you cannot mount
anything, move, or attack anything.  Once you do this, you become visible to everyone.

Sneak is useful if you want to move silently without players noticing you moving
through the room.  If you flee, you will stop sneaking and will have to 'sneak' again.

Visible (vis) cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
effectively making you visible again to all.

hindex (help index) is used to browse the help index available in Rafermand.
You can either use the variable toplevel to see only the toplevel of the map
and click on there to view helpfiles/indexes in that index.

hindex map is used to show the whole map of the index.  This might not be the
best idea because it will scroll and you will have to scroll back up to click on
the index you want.

Lastly, you can use hindex <index> to look at an index of your choice.  There is
also the arguments of nohfiles and collapse.  nohfiles will not show the helpfiles
in the index and collapse will show all the indexes and their helpfiles below the
index you chose.

(NOTE:  There is a value called shorthelp in config.  This will make help not show
 similiar helpfiles when you type help <help file>)

On a final note:  hindex uses mxp to allow you to point and click (HELP MXP)

this command was initially designed as a maintenance tool to help us
track help files, it is also available to players so that they can
capture a listing of the help files available to them. 
 
Note - You may only view help files that are coded for viewing by your
       level or lower.
 
Note - The list of help files is quite extensive, and the command does
       not as yet have a way to filter/shorten the list. Screen capture

0 HOBBIT~
#General Information Races~
#END~
----------------------------------------------BIO----------------------------------------------------
Hobbits, a passive, docile race of naturally contented, short, stocky species, the hobbits tend to get 
along with most civilized races.  They bear no ill will to any save those whom have harmed the hobbits, 
and even so, they rarely bare grudges for long.  They are prized for their natural mind for trading, 
and are commonly involved in competitive guilds.  Few hobbits practice magick, and it is unknown if it 
is from simple lack of interest, or inability to do as such.  Due to their hand in trade, hobbits find
it easy to negotiate treaties to benefit themselves.  Extremely interested in intellectual pursuits, 
most hobbits would be content living a life wrapped in the luxuries of the home, though a few have 
adventurous spirits.  The hobbits live in a variety of environments, depending on their needs.  Some 
live in traditional, hollowed out hills, others find that artificial shelters, wrought of natural 
materials, are more suitable.  Hobbits only truly hate anything that would deny them the simple 
pleasures of everyday life, so their villages are more or less open to any traveller.  Combining this
with their guilds gives the hobbits a knack for collecting even the rarest of trades, as well as 
information.  Being fond of gossip,  the elders of Hobbit villagers have an army of innocent spies 
reporting to them.  Hobbprattle, a derogitory name given to the seemingly pointless, nonsensicle 
gossip of the hobbits, is a notorious form of transferring information, as their oversimplifying of
information is only readily understood by others of their kind.

HOLYLIGHT is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and

easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

INVIS is a toggle which makes you completely invisible to all player characters
of lower level than you, and to all mobiles.

When an immortal is INVIS, they will have a flag on the who list which 
indicates their level of invisibility, such as (51) for INVIS 51.  A 
similar flag will also appear when you 'LOOK' in a room - this flag will 
say (Invis 51).

1 HOOD CLOAK CLOAKS ROBE ROBES~
#General Roleplaying~
#Combat~
#END~
Syntax: hood on/off

By getting a cloak (one can be found at Bare Essentials) you can effectively cloak
your identity from everyone but the immortals.  By wearing a cloak you first hide
your equipment and inventory from anyone trying to sneak a peak at it.  This can
be useful because you can hide your power from your advesery.  The other option
that is useful is the ability to hide your identity while wearing the hood.  If
you type hood on you will fasten your hood up and you will become unknown to everyone
around you.  This can be handy if you plan on mugging and killing an individual, but
it is typically viewed as a threat to hide your identity from an individual.  In
certain kingdoms, they might even have their guards set to not allow people to pass
if you are cloaked and/or wearing a hood.  So, as a final thought, just be careful
about roaming around in a cloak because anyone who wants to hide their identity is
most likely asking for trouble.

----------------------------------------------BIO----------------------------------------------------
Humans, as in all worlds, are fickle.  Humans serve many masters, many goals, and numerous 
selfish motives.  Generally, humans tend to easily fit in with those whom share similar goals 
and ideals, as pure, dark, or gray as they may be.  Humans are masters of tactical warfare, 
and as such, are adept at pushing their culture upon others.  Humans especially distrust the races 
which were naturally able to use certain primal forces as sources of magick, as they were unable to 
truly grasp said energies until the immortals began to return to the once forsaken world.

1 ICESHIELD FIRESHIELD SHOCKSHIELD~
#Magic Mage Offensive~
#END~
Iceshield conjures an encompassing shield of ice which will return the
attacks of your enemy with tongues of cold.
Syntax:  cast iceshield
 
Fireshield surrounds the caster with a wall of fire which returns your
enemies' attacks with balls of fire.
Syntax:  cast fireshield
 
Shockshield surrounds the caster with a field of electric energy which will
return your enemies' attacks with bolts of lightning.
Syntax:  cast shockshield

Like shields will negate each other's effects.  For example, if your enemy
has fireshield, your fireshield will counter any fireballs thrown by his,
and his will counter any fireballs thrown by yours.

Note:  All 3 shields strength is based on the intelligence of the one with the
shields.  The more intelligence you have, the more damage the shields will do.

Syntax:  ignore
Syntax:  ignore <character>
Syntax:  ignore reply/none
 
Ignore allows you to ignore other characters in Rafermand.  All tells,
says, socials, and emotes from these characters will be blocked (gagged
out).  You will still see their communications through public channels,
however.
 
Simply typing ignore will give you a list of all the characters you are
currently ignoring.
 
Ignore <character> allows you to add or remove a character from your list
of ignored players.  If the name is already on the list it will be removed.
If the name is not on the list it will be added.  Note that only the names
of actual characters will be accepted and that it is not necessary for
them to be logged on at the time.
 
Ignore reply will cause you to ignore the last person to send you a tell.
This can be used to prevent invisible people from spamming you.
 
Ignore none will set you to ignoring no one.

Syntax: imbue <amount> [item]
        imbue with amount and no item specified will release mana into the room's
        node, if there is one.

Imbue is a skill used to transfer some mana from yourself to an item or a room.

The purpose for this is to give people alternative sources of mana to be used for
spells of various kinds.

Imbue an item:
    You need 2 things for this, a gem (the rarer the gem, the better it is), and
    some jewlery to place the gem into.
    You do this by using the SETGEM command (see help SETGEM)

    Once a gem has been set in a piece of jewlery, you can then imbue the resulting
    item with mana. That mana can then be drawn from the item in order to cast
    spells when your mana is drained.

Imbue a room:
    To imbue a room with mana you first need to find a node. The only way to do this
    is by imbuing mana into different rooms. You will know when you have found a node.
    These nodes generate their own mana, but at relatively slow and small increments.
    They can store very large amounts of mana, and are constantly generating more.
    With these nodes you can cast special spells that need huge amounts of mana to
    function.

Syntax:  immhost
This command is for setting the hosts allowed for immortals that are added
with this command.  Wildcards are allowed (*), so *edu, would allow any domain
from edu connect and 127*, would allow any local domain to connect.
IMMHOST without arguments will show a list of names and what domains they are
allowed to connect from.
To delete a command you need to provide the name and the host, this allows
for multiple hosts for a certain name.
This file won't be saved until the immhost save command is issued.

2 'IMMORTAL RULE' 'IMMORTAL RULES' IMMORTALRULE IMMORTALRULES~
#Immortal ImmLaws~
#END~
&gBelow are a list of rules for Rafermand involving Immortals.  You are
to know these rules from the point they they are posted and you are
notified.  Any rule added later will not be held against you unless we
feel it was a "common sense" rule.  Some rules might not be here, but we
think some things do not have to be said, but are implied to be true.
If you are in violation of these rules, you can either be warned,
demoted, or balzhured based on the severity of the matter.  If you feel
you have been wronged by the staff, you may post a note in an INTELLIGENT
manner and if you have the backing of most of the immortals, and at least
2/3 of the staff, you will be put back to where you were, or the
punishment will be reduced.  Any drop from an important caste will be
reviewed by the whole staff before happening (drop from maybe admin to
a normal immortal).  (Note: admin, staff, owners, this all means that
the player is level 71 or higher and/or has a caste of staff or admin.
A level 61 player is not staff)

All the rules are broke up into sections.  The first section are going
to be the "implied rules" so you know what is going on.  After that, a
list of the categories of rules will be at the end and you can goto
that helpfile to read them.  You should read every rule and understand
them.  If you think something is wrong, please contact Xerves or Stakk
about the rule and please give us the rule word for word and your
problem with it.  Thanks.

#Immortal ImmLaws~
#END~
&RCOMMANDS - PLAYER RELATED&g
*   If you are able to restore players, you are not to restore players
    at a regular interval.  Wait maybe an hour or two before doing it,
    or just contact an admin about a good time to do so.  Not going to
    get killed for this rule, but please don't abuse it.
*   Lower level immortals should not be spelling up players unless it is
    part of a quest.
*   Murdering and Slaying of immortals is allowed as long as they say it
    is ok.  Do not chase and bug immortals while they are working, or
    start something with them if they are.  Excessive playing will get a
    warning then a demotion.  Also, this rule does not apply for mortals,
    you cannot kill even if they tell you to.  (Tell them to delete if
    they want to die horribly)

                              &RCOMMANDS - IMMORTAL RELATED&g

*   Wizinvis rules - Wizinvis is to hide from players and or lower
    immortals.  You are not allowed to follow them around in silence and
    peek in on their lives unless you are staff or appointed to.  If this
    becomes a problem, wizinvis might be removed from you.  Also, for
    those who can follow around morts, you are not to pass any
    conversation back to a public or private channel unless it is 
    for IMMORTAL eyes only, and the information should be tasteful and
    useful.  Please keep in mind we want the mortals to be secure that 
    wandering eyes are not watching their every thought and action.
    Lastly, this applies to people below staff level that have wizinvis.
*   Switch, force, echo, recho, mecho, etc are not play toys and
    should not be abused.  If you are caught playing around to much,
    it can lead to a demotion or balzhur.  If you wish to test things
    out to an excessive point, leave a valid reason on a board before
    doing.  You are here to help build and have fun doing it, but not
    here just to have fun playing god against mobs.
*   For those who can bodybag, please read (help imm bodybag)

2 IMMORTEQUIPMENT~
#Immortal ImmLaws~
#END~
&REQUIPMENT RULES&g

*   No equipment should be handed out to a player, nor any equipment 
    changed or restrung without permission of the staff.  A quest with 
    such handouts are allowed as long as the quest council says it is
    ok.  Breaking of this rule is an instant demotion or if very
    severe, balzhur.
*   Personal equipment is allowed, however there are rules.  Your
    equipment should not add more than 10 to ANY stat, and 2000 to
    HP/MANA/MOVE.  Also, you should keep the damage a weapon can do
    round by round down below 150.  Also, your AC on an item should not
    go over 25 for ANY REASON.  Violation of this is first a warning then 
    a demotion.  This causes problems which take time to fix and is really 
    unwarranted because you cannot die.
*   You can mset your stats to make yourself stronger.  I recommend 
    that you set HP/Mana/Move to no more than 20000 and anything else
    can be maxed to the amount allowed.  Also, gold can be set but do
    not trying to go over the max that the code does not allow you to
    set (10mil).  If you are found trying to build up your wealth by
    doing transfers, etc, you will be warned or demoted.  I take the
    economy of Rafermand very seriously and don't need a ton of money
    floating around.

2 IMMORTKINGDOM~
#Immortal ImmLaws~
#END~
When it comes to kingdom matters, unless you have some direct influence based on RPing
rules, you should avoid resolving any kingdom matters.  Instead, any matters should be
left to Xerves or anyone who has been appointed to resolve kingdom matters besides Xerves.
You should not take anything into your own hands unless the following comes up (and you are
to deal with it as mentioned).

1.  Spam killing.  This involves planting a military in a respawn room and killing players over
    and over as they respawn.  You should check to make sure a kingdom has not changed their
    respawn room to invoke this (because it is an easy way to get mobs removed).  If it is found
    out the other kingdom deliberately done this you are to ask them to remove the mobiles from
    the respawn.  If they refuse to do so, you slay the mobs.  If you aware that this group has
    been asked more then once, you slay the mobs.  If you have to slay any mobs, you post it to
    the kingdom board along with your reasons and what you slayed.
    
That is it, anything else is legal including planting a military at an entrance of a kingdom,
surrounding a respawn room with military, or putting military in every room in a kingdom.  It
is up to the players to find a way out of the situation, even if it looks unfair.

In addition, you are not to spread "ideas" to other kingdoms on what they should do about who.  You
are not to give away INFORMATION of any kind that would help or hurt the kingdom.  You are allowed
to listen to each kingdom through their kingdom channel or talk to them, but you are not allowed to
pass any information learned from any avenue.  If you are found to be abusing such rules, you will
be demoted or balzhured.  In order to keep up with current doings, it is important to have the
trust of the players to tell us what is going on, so don't abuse this trust.

#Immortal ImmLaws~

&RPERSONAL - PLAYER ISSUES&g
*   You are not allowed to treat mortals like dirt.  Be kind yet
    forceful if needed, but don't go overboard.  Again, you are a direct
    reflection of our immortals, do not give us bad PR (public relations).
*   You should be even more respectful to players who are not causing
    problems.  You can talk and joke with them, but do not harass them.
    If you are having a problem with a mortal, tell a higher level
    immortal and just ignore them or ask them kindly to stop.  The mortal
    will be dealt with in a quick matter, so do not make things worse.
*   You are not allowed to give out area secrets to players even if
    bribed.  This does not include speed walk directions of non hidden
    areas or level ranges on the area (in that case tell them to type
    area).  This also includes transfers, goto, forces, or forced
    speedwalks.  If they want a public speed walk direction you are
    allowed to provide them, but let the players provide them first.
    Violation of the area secrets is an instant balzhur, and the
    transfers and forces might be a warning or demotion depending on
    the violation.  This rule will not be violated!
*   Immortals are allowed to have players, but here are the rules
    If you are going to have a character, you should not cheat for this
    character by giving equipment, restoring, sset, etc.  If this character
    is going to be part of the playing world it is best to keep it secret
    that the player is an immortal because the players tend not to like that.
    If you want to run a test char, see below rule.
*   Some immortals will be allowed to run a test character.  This player
    is public knowledge and they know it is you.  The test character is
    not allowed to group, exchange items, give gold, spell-ups, etc.

&RPERSONAL - RAFERMAND/IMMORTAL ISSUES&g
*   Sharing of password is an instant balzhur.  You are in no way to
    allow anyone else login to your immortal without Xerves's permission. 
    There will be no discussion or appeal, just not tolerated.
*   We can refuse to include your area based on many things even if you
    put 2 months of work into it.  This is not common, but your area must
    follow our stat rules and other things.  Please make sure ot follow
    whatever stat charts are out and try not to cheat things into the game.
*   If you have any ideas on what to add, please post them to the idea
    board instead of to Xerves or his email, icq, etc.  I don't remember
    well and it is much easier for me to read them off the board at a
    later time.
*   Do not excessively spam or bug a higher level immortal (not 1 level,
    but a major job position like builder to head builder) majorly.  If
    you have a request post a note or ask kindly.  We will get back to
    you soon, and if we forgot, ask again soon.
*   Not a rule but a preference.  Do not refer to Xerves as sir,
    master, honorable one, etc.  I prefer to go by Xerves and that is
    it.  I also don't like it when people do the "kiss-ass" socials.
    You know what I mean and please don't do all of that.  Shows to me
    that you are begging and is very unwanting of you.
*   You are not to advertise for us unless asked or told to a private
    group of friends on another mud or in IRL.  Such violations would
    be posting a note to mudconnector without my approval or going to
    other muds and bugging players there.  This might make us look bad
    and I don't want to explain why that happened.  If you want to make
    a homepage or put something in your email address, that is ok.
*   You are to be respectful to other immortals and staff.  Respectful
    does not mean bowing and talking kindly, but just showing some
    decency and not spamming and typing in caps.  Some of us will
    find that to be very immature and can quickly get you removed as
    an immortal.

    This includes any type of banning, force quits, channel blocking,
    lagging, watches, logs, slaying, murdering, transferring.  You are
    allowed to talk with the player and try to calm them down though.
*   Logging of anybody (mortal or immortal) is not allowed without the
    permission of staff or anyone else appointed to do so.  This
    shouldn't be a problem because log it at higher levels though.
*   Staff reserves the right to log you without telling your or asking
    permission nor do they have to tell you they are if you ask.
    Anything found will not be distributed unless it affects your
    immship ability (meaning we will not share any discussions or actions
    of yours that is not mud related or perfectly alright.  If it isn't
    a reason to demote you or balzhur you, it will never go any further
    than the logs.  I don't personally read all logs and I could care
    less about your personal lives either).

&c&wIt is important to follow whatever rules are established when it come sto
Rping.  You can find more info over the current RP scenerios at the webiste
&Cwww.rafermand.com/rpinfo.htm&c&w.  You will find info over each race, some
background over the mud, along with history of what has been going on in Rafermand.

Now for the fun part, Rping a character.  Immortals are allowed to RP a deity
with permission of the RP council or Xerves.  This deity needs to be well thought
out and aware to the RP council and to the players if it is allowed or warranted.
Before rping, you will be brought through the current rules at the time.  Rules
might change based on time, scenarios, and just the general reaction of the players
to certain things.  It is best to always ask what is allowed before stretching any
lines.

Failure to observe rules will lead into removal of being able to RP or even balzhur
if it is abused enough.

1 IMMRULES~
#General Laws~
#END~
These are rules that immortals cannot violate against a mortal (this does not
apply for immortals).  If one of these rules are being violated, please notify
Xerves at rafermand@home.com and he or Stakk will deal with it.  It is very
important that you do this so we can right any wrongs and take care of any
problems before they expand even farther.

1.  Immortals are not allowed to slay you if they are not officially punishing
    you for something (they will tell you this, and the reasons why).  Slaying
    includes casing spells to kill you, murdering you, dropping you into a
    death trap, or any other constructive way of killing you.
2.  Immortals are not allowed to copy anything you said to them through a public
    channel, or a private channel to another.
3.  Immortals are not to give MASSIVE spellups or multiple restores to the mud
    in a set time.  If you think they are going overboard, please post a note.
4.  Immortals are not to load mobs/objs for you, or to weaken or tank a mob for
    you in anyway unless Xerves is present.
5.  Known immortal players (known imm players will be posted to a board) are not
    to help you kill a mob or give equipment (includes gold).  They can however
    spell you up.

Those are at least 5 major rules.  If you think an immortal is being rude and
abnoxious, please post a note or email about it and it will be dealt with.

1 INFRAVISION INFRARED~
#General Information~

Infravision is a rare gift to the dwarves that allow them to see in the night
as if they have a light.  This includes the ability to see and look at things
and see what they fully look like instead of just "a red shape is here".  
In Rafermand infravision is the same as "night vision".
~

3 INSTALLAREA~
#Immortal Building BuildingSetup~
#END~
Syntax: installarea <area filename> <full area name/title>

Installs a prototype area into the mud as a non-prototype area.
The filename can be fixed with aset, (don't forget to foldarea the new name.)

Currently the builder should quit and have his/her vnums cleared manually.
(This should be fixed soon).
~

3 INSTAROOM~
#Immortal Building Resets~
#END~
Syntax: instaroom

A very useful command for creating exits on the go.  Instaroom will
generate most of the resets for you in the room.  These exits
include....

  1.  Objects on Ground
  2.  Mobs
  3.  Objects on Mob
  4.  Objects worn by mob
  5.  Objects in Objects (Containers)
  6.  Containers on Mobs
  7.  Door Resets (open/closed/locked/secret, etc)

Things to remember.....

  1.  Any object on the ground will reset, including blood, corpses
  2.  To have more than 1 like object on the ground, they have to
      be seperate vnums (a fix coming later)
  3.  If you change a door from the way you had it, and typed
      instaroom, it will load that way next time the area resets.
  4.  To save changes, must savearea (or foldarea).

1 INTRODUCTION INTRODUCE~
#General Roleplaying~
#General AtPlayers~
#END~
Syntax: introduce [self/other target/kingdom] [victim]

Welcome to the introduction system 101 helpfile.  A few muds out there are changing
to a more RP themed version of player interaction and are changing to introduction
style systems.  Here at Rafermand, we run such a system.  For those who have never
seen it, it works something like this.

When you first enter this world, you are known to no mortal and no mortal is known
to you.  A few immortals whom are visible might be known to you, but that is totally
up to them if they decide to make their name known.  Until you introduce yourself to
someone, they will see you like this
    >>> a short, brown haired, white human is here before you.
Now, as rather informational as that is, there could be more than one person roaming
Rafermand that looks like this.  In order to make yourself known to someone you have
to introduce yourself to them.  After you do so, you can only hope they will introduce
themselves back.  Once the formalities are done, you now know the person you were just
talking to.  You will remember their name for a long period of time, but if the player
is absent from the mud for a matter of months, you will actually forget his/her name.
In addition to the introduction side of things, there is also the "rememberence" side
of it.  If you are attacked by an unknown PC, you will remember this person as MYATTACKER
or MYKILLER.  If the person assaults you enough times, you might even learn his/her name
throught he process.  In order to remove such flags from a person, you need to use the
PARDON command.  It removes all flags and returns your knowledge of that person from bad
to good.

NEXT, there is the HOOD command.  To get more information over the implications of a
cloak and its hood, type HELP HOOD.

Lastly, there are a few config options (type config) that you can set that will affect
how the introduction system works.  They are...

Player
-----------
SHOWPC - Turning this on will put a PC in front of a PC.

Immortal
-----------
SHOWASIMM - Turning this on will put a IMM in front of your name/descr
SHOWNAMES - Shows the names of everyone logged in.
UKNOWN - Universally Known.  Everyone knows who you are.

0 INVIS INVISIBILITY~
#General Information~
#END~
Only the most masterful of creatures are said to possess this secret enchantment.
It allows them to be completely invisible to the eyes of those who cannot see
the invisible.  It is not known of what possesses this talent, but it has been
passed down in legend of great unseen beasts reaking havok on a poor group of
folks.
~

2 IPCOMPARE~
#Immortal ImmPlayers~
#END~
ipcompare total
ipcompare <person> [room|area|world] [#]
ipcompare <site>   [room|area|world] [#]

Unless you have 550 players, you probably won't need this, you can do it by eye
with clones or users.  It is used to compare a user and see if he/she is using
a unique ip, if not, what clones are out there.  It also has a variable for total
to list out the total number of unique ips, and you can also use arguments to check
all in a room, area, or the default, the world.

For those who are looking to train in the sphere of Earth, jagged spike is a good starting

equipment damage, jagged spike offers everything that the beginning mage needs.

1 JOBS JOB~
#Kingdoms Management~
#Kingdoms Creation~
#END~
Jobs are well jobs.  They are special type of skill/class you can hold
durring the course of the game.  Most of the time you can only have 1
job, but it is possible to hold two under right occasions.  Right now, this
system is being worked on, but we do have a few available, and more will
be posted on how to get a certain job (view rafermand page for more job
info)

Current jobs working in Rafermand are....

Unemployed (Value is 0)
--------------
Speaks for itself, the player does not hold a job and is considered a normal
player.  No special additional skills are given to this player.

Extractors (Value is 1)
----------
Extractors are the primary working class in the caste system.  The job is
typically reserved for the poor and low caste and provide money and a place
to live for them.  Extractors harvest everything that is harvestable in the
world.
    Help: Extractinfo

Merchant (Value is 2)
--------
Merchants are able to own shopkeepers and configure them to sell and buy
different stuff.  The keepers will keep all items over crashes and reboots
and can exchange cash and items with the shopkeeper at will.  A very
profitable job, but takes quite a bit of money to get into, plus it can
   Help: Keeperinfo

Gambler (Value is 3)
--------------
These are special shops ran by the leader that provides gambling services
to the public.  Most of the time the shop owner makes a decent profit, but
it is possible for the player to actually win if they are lucky.
   Help: Gamblerinfo

Carpenters (Value is 4)
----------
A very important class that relies on extractors and the kingdoms mainly.
Carpenters have the ability to design rooms for kingdoms or private
individuals under contract.  Carpenters can create just about any room and
even are blessed with a really good skill to add even some magical aspects
to rooms.  A kingdom without a few of these tends to go nowhere.
   Help: Carpenterinfo
   
Surveyors (Value is 5)
---------
Surveyors have the ability to survey the land for resources that the extractors
can remove from the land.  Typically an early job or a job that belongs to very
few people.  Also, surveyors can survey the current land to see how much resources
are left, very useful for telling if a mountain has been surveyed or to see how
much more tree is left to cut down.

1 JOINKINGDOM LEAVEKINGDOM KOUTCAST~
#Kingdoms Management~
#END~
Syntax: joinkingdom <num>
Syntax: leavekingdom
Syntax: koutcast <player>

Joinkindom is used to join a kingdom of choice.  You can only join player
created Kingdoms (cannot join Rafermand, etc).  By just typing joinkingdom
you will get a list of kingdoms with a few stats.  Just use the number (num)
in the num slot to join that kingdom.  Also, you might not be able to join 
if they are not allowing (will show up on the stats if they are not.

Leavekingdom simply leaves the kingdom.  You will end up back in Rafermand
kingdom.  It is possible to join the kingdom again, but soon they will be
able to ban certain names from their kingdom, so be careful.

Koutast is a high caste command that allows a person in the kingdom to
boot out a player out of their kingdom.  If the person has enough authority
that is.  The target has to be online and a player, and the player does not
have to be in the same room.

1 KEEPERINFO~
#Kingdoms Creation~
#END~
The new Keeper code allows players to own and maintain shopkeepers.  The
6 commands associated with this are these commands

  resetkeeper
  keeperstat
  keeperset
  goldgive
  keeperinfo
  pcshops

Each command has their own helpfile, and please take the time to read
them.  As for how this all works and how to obtain a shopkeeper will
be listed below.

First, to get a shopkeeper you have to do a few things.  First, you must
reach a caste rating of 7 (Merchant) and then you must request a shopkeeper
from either (in order if there are ones) the mayor of the city, a Lord,
the King/QUEEN of the land, or a high level Immortal.  Try to ask all those
people in order they are listed.  If you are granted your request, you will
be given a mob in a certain area and you will be able to get info over
him/her and do other stuff to him/her.  Any transactions you do with the
mob will not cost you anything.  In addition, because the mob you have is
special compared to other shopkeepers, your mob will keeper the items he/she
buys over reboot.  Also, you become the owner of anything bought and sold
to the keeper, and can give/take gold, set prices.  However, you have to
be careful because your shopkeeper is not invinsible and might be able to
be killed or robbed.  So asking to Train your shopkeeper might be a good
idea if you have the money.

Well that is it in a nutshell.  More stuff will probably be added as time
goes on and bugs are found, so try to check this helpfile every day for
any added commands or info.

4 KEEPERWORK~
#Kingdoms Creation~
#END~
The code is fairly complex and spans through some resets and folding functions
to make sure the items stay on the mob.  What happens is when the item is sold
to the shopkeeper, the item is cloned and stored at a vnum in the zone with the
shopkeeper.  Then, when the item is sold, the item is cloned again, but this
time back to the orginal vnum of where it came from.  Also, when it is sold, the
cloned object's vnum is deleted from the list.  As long as the keepers in the
area aren't holding 150 items a peice, there should be plenty of room for
objects as they continue to go through the cycle.

Also, everything this happens (buying/selling) the mob is reseted into the
room again, and the area folds to save the changes.  That is why all the
keepers will have a room in a seperate area that will probably be called
Keeper's Haven or something like that (probably keeper.are file), and will
be about 1000 vnums in size.  Also, a MUST, the vnum of the keeper and the
room it occupies has to be the same.  To save some coding, I coded in the
vnums to be the same, so they must be the same for the commands to work.
I hope this provides some understand, and please, do not go running your
mouth to every little person on how this works.

1 KINGDOMS KINGDOM~
#Kingdoms~
#END~
Kingdoms are the basic backbone of the Caste system and are what you would
call a basic Feudal System.  There are rulers of the kingdoms who have
pretty much complete power over the kingdom (there are still a few rules to
keep things from getting out of hand), but for most issues, total power.
You can either join a kingdom, or stay neutral and belong to the starting
out kingdom of Rafermand (which is Neutral).  Once in a kingdom, you will
have access to their city and will be under the rule of the King and his/her
rules.  It is important to find the proper kingdom for you and make sure you
are willing to follow the King and the ruling caste of that Kingdom.  In
the beginning there will be only a few kingdoms, but later on, hopefully, there
will be a few more.

You can use the command 'showkingdoms' to get a list of Kingdoms and it will
provide some basic information, and then you can use the "joinkingdom" to join
a kingdom.  The king of the kingdom or others who have the power to remove you
can ask you to leave or boot you out at any time, so it is a good idea to
carefully choose your allies and do not anger them.

If you think that all the kingdoms that exist are not for you, you can try 
to start your own kingdom. However, to start a kingdom required a rather 
deep pocket of 400000 gold coins, and it requires a bit of work to obtain this
much gold by ones self.  Once you have the gold, just goto a spot in the 
Kingdom wilderness you want to start your kingdom and type startkingdom 
<name> 

That is about it for now, below is a helpfile with a command list for kingdom
use, check it out if you wish (not all commands are available for everyone).

Syntax: klog search <keyword> time <start time> <end time>
Syntax: klog prune time <time/-1>
Syntax: klog prune lines <lines/-1>
Syntax: klog clear now

Used to show the log of doings in your kingdom.  If you meet the
MinReadLog value, you can read the log.  If you are the king or a
staff level immortal, you can also clear out the log and prune it.  

There are a lot of changes to the klog system in 2.1 to make it
a lot better yet able to maintain a good robust usage for it.
The first options are just a list.  You can get a linecount of
everything in your log, or you can specify how many lines to
show from the start or a certain range.  If you have more than 400
or so lines in your log, you probably want to search it by groups
of 400 or so.

You can also search by time if you want to see what happened during
a certain time.  The parsing for the time looks like this
   Feb 18 2:50 2003
   2:18:2:50:2003 
You use military time for this thing, so 2 PM is 14:00.  You can
use this to get a list of what happened in a few hours or a few
minutes.

Next is a search by type.  There are catagories things are logged
under.  They show up in the log as such
   [create         ]
You can do a type search like this and it accepts line arguments

Then probably the most useful search, the keyword search.  You can
use the keyword search to search for any keyword in the description
in the log (the right most part).  Keyword searches take line and
time arguments.

Lastly the prune options.  You can either prune by time, lines, or
both.  Lines is pretty easy, you just specify the number of lines
and at certain intervals in time it will prune out the oldest
log entries for you.  If you set the value to -1 it will disable
this feature.  The time feature uses the following expression
   7 days 12 hours 15 minutes 5 seconds
   7:12:15:5
You can use it to to clean out a log entry if it is beyond the
time specified.  The time used here is RL time, so if you put in
1:0:0:0 it would clear out anything that is over a day old.  Setting
the value to -1 will disable this feature.  You can see the current
settings in townvalues.

You can use the logsettings command to filter what types are entered
into the log.  If you are sick of seeing 1000s of extraction messages
when you dump 80 units of wood, just turn that type off (HELP LOGSETTINGS)

Rafermand beleive that some unknown entity has landed in the lake and
created a hell hole out of a once peaceful forest area.  Also, a man

Due to our introduction system and use of a fame system, each player now has a
last name.  Each character when it starts out picks a unique lastname.  Lastnames
will show up if you aquire enough fame, or the target knows you.  Once you are in
the game, you can also join another family or house by having someone in that house
accept you in by using the offername command (HELP OFFERNAME).  Those in the same
family will have the lastname.  

You cannot pick a lastname that is a person's firstname, is on the reserved list, or
has illegal characters.  You can be denied a lastname in the authorization process and
be forced to change it.  If you are asked to change it after that, you will have to
relogin and change it at the login process.

things, but certain Bots will not be allowed here.  These bots are
as follows.

Allowed
---------------
Eating/Drinking/Quaffing Scripts
Extracting bots(extracting materials from the map)
Text triggers (leveling, arrivals, etc)
Healing/Spell up Bots (they say something, they get healed)
* Note - certain kinds of healing bots are disallowed, see below

Not Allowed
-------------------
Leveling Bots (You get triggered by a string and you go pillage an area)
Killing Bots (Almost same as above, but it involves gold/path laying, etc)
Arrival to a room Bots (like Recall messages, etc, gets spammy quick)
Fully unattended Healing/Spell up Bots (characters you don't play but leave
around for people to ask for spellups, heals)


The above list is not all of the bots that exist for use, but are a general list
of common ones that came to my mind.  A general rule of thumb is do not create a
bot that will violate any other rules and do not create a bot that will dominate
an area and slay everything in it so no one else gets a chance.  Also, if your bot
is caught misbehaving even if you did not intend it to do so, you still will be
held responsible.  If you are going to make a bot, be responsible enough to watch
what it is doing every once and awhile and make sure you are leaving the challenge
and fun intacted.

-1 'LAW CHANNELS'~
#General Laws~
#END~
.
&GSpam (repeating the same message repeatedly or otherwise purposely causing
the screen to scroll), harassment (including sexual) and abusive behavior are
not permitted on any channel (this includes in 'say' or 'tell').  Do not
continue to 'tell' to someone after they have asked you to stop.

Our rules on profanity is this.  You may use it slightly on our channels
but if you are asked to quit using it or settle down and you refuse, you
are open to silencing or anything other punishment to make you stop.
__NOTE__ If you are caught talking about highly suggest sexual material
on a channel, I will silence you or ask you to stop depending on the
content and what is being said.  We have males and females alike that
find it highly offensive and will not be permitted.  It is sexual
harassment if you did not know, and it will not be tolerated.

If you are asked to change the subject or quit talking about a subject by
an immortal, you are to obey the immortal no MATTER what LEVEL they are.
If you have a problem with what the immortal requested, you may post
a complaint to the gboards (help gboard) and it will be addressed.  If
you refuse to quit, you will be silenced or worse.

Finally, these rules do apply for immortals too, you are held to a higher
standard than the mortals because you represent me just like you would
represent an employer.  I don't expect you to be perfect, but I expect
you to behave.  This kind of an offense is a warning, but I have demoted
people for it before, so don't push me or the council of complaints.

&WWarning:  &GArguing with or flaming immortals on channels _WILL_ get you
silenced or worse, and this may extend to your other characters as well if
you push the matter.  Rafermand has gboards and councils to contact with
complaints and doing it in a harsh and wrong way will only get you in
more trouble. Also if ANY immortal asks you to stop using profanity then stop.
Even if you think that word(s) are not that bad just do not say that word(s).
If you want to sing or use some harsh language then do it in a telepath to your
friend or on say but do NOT use a public channel. That means everything from chat
to music. Avatars must also obey this rule when speaking on avtalk. Avatars should
follow the same rules for avtalk as they should and will for the other main channels.
Again no matter if it is a level 51 immortal or a level 75 immortal, if they ask you
to stop using that type of language or to change the subject matter, then please do
so.

-1 'LAW CHARM'~
#General Laws~
#END~
.
&GDo not bring aggressive mobs into or near Rolen camp, as when their charm
wears off (either naturally or by attack) their aggressive nature will
return.  Also do not bring aggressive mobs into areas which are lower in
level than the area from which the mob originally came.  You can use the
'areas' command to check an area's level.  See 'help charm' for more.
~

-1 'LAW CHEATING'~
#General~
#END~
.
&GCheating is a very serious offense and subjects _all_ characters involved
to a slay, purge (loss of all equipment), freeze, balzhur deny or even a site ban.

What is considered cheating?
 - exploiting (intentionally using) a bug to gain equipment or gold
 - intentionally causing the system to crash
 - intentionally duplicating equipment or gold
 - knowingly accepting illegal equipment (see above) from others
 - attempting to duplicate equipment or gold -- * even if not successful *
 - using or making profit from equipment that was accidentally duplicated
 - using gold that was accidentally duplicated

What also should be reported?
 - Mobs that are set wrong (mobs with too much gold)
 - Any bugs or typos
 - Anything that just looks out of place.

Cheating hurts the game, and every player in the game.  Protect yourself
and report any bugs you find, and inform the Immortals if you have strong
cause to believe someone is engaged in any of the above.

If you find yourself with duplicated items, gold, or have found you a
little bug, please report it to the immortals.  If there is a problem
with a mob, we do ask that you tell us, and if you are caught plundering
the mob, you might be punished or you might not depending on HOW bad the
error is.  If a mob is giving a million gold, you better damn well tell
us, if you are caught, your gold will be removed and probably something
worse.

                             __NOTE__
Bug reports sometimes get rewards and sometimes don't.  Please don't ask
for rewards for bug reports.  We are developing policies for people who
help with bugs, but asking for levels, a different class, massive amounts
of gold or QP won't be tollerated.  We do like your help, but our rewards
will be small, not something that will change the balance of the mud.

-1 'LAW DELETION'~
#General Laws~
#END~
As stated in the delete help file, deletion of a player is a deletion
of a player.  You will not be given the player back at all.  In order
to delete the password must be required and does not happen accidently.
Don't ask for anything back after you deleted even it was RARE quest
equipment or removed equipment.  Nothing will be given back, NOTHING.

In rare cases I give back deleted players, but don't expect it after
deleting every time.
~

-1 'LAW HARASSMENT'~
#General Laws~
#END~
.
&GHarassment is giving a person unwanted attention, whether you perceive it
as negative or positive attention.  If a person is made to be uncomfortable
by your attention or comments, you are harassing that person.  If a person
asks you to desist in talking to them or performing socials on them, and
you do not stop, you are harassing that person.  If you act in an intimate
manner to a character, without their permission, you are harassing that
person.

No form of harassment is tolerated in Rafermand.  We especially frown upon
unwanted comments or actions with a sexual nature or explicit content.  If
you do not have an intimate relationship with the person, whether in real
life or within Rafermand, you should refrain from using suggestive actions
and/or comments.

If you are caught harassing another player in any way, you can be silenced,
helled, frozen, denied, and/or site banned.  Harassing another player is a
serious violation of the rules and will not be permitted.  If you choose
to harass an immortal, you are choosing to be removed from the game.

NOTE:  If you are asked by an immortal to answer a question even if he/she
is visible or not it is who of you to answer the question.  A simple
reponse is all that is needed.  If an immortal has to ask you more than
2 or 3 times for an answer and you are there to hear him/her, you might
suffer punishment depending on the circumstances.

~

-1 'LAW IMM REQUESTS' 'LAW IMM REQUEST'~
#General Laws~
#END~
.
&GIt has became rather clear to me to post this rule because players
don't know what immortals can and cannot do for them.  Below is a
list of what not to ask an immortal and what you can ask.  If it
is listed in the not ask, typically there will be a small note on
possible costs or special items that can be given for the request.
All immortals reserve the right to deny these special requests and
spamming the immortals with requests can result in silence, helling,
freezing, banning, deletion, you name it, the immortal can do it.

Note:  This is in regard to mortals asking immortals, mortals can
ask anything, but still remember, you are not to harrass them.

Not Allowed Requests:
1.  Specific locations of any area, room, equipment or stash of
    gold that hasn't been released on the player page.  You may
    ask a general location of an area if it is not on a map or
    ask if we can release where an object/mob is area wise.  We
    do not have to tell you the location if we choose not and
    continued asking once we have told you no will be a warning
    and then a silence or worse.  We are busy and don't want to
    be nagged.
2.  You may not ask for a restore unless you have a restore token.
    Restores are done when we feel like it or when we feel someone
    might need it (you are better off hinting than blatantly asking).
3.  We will NOT, NO WAY, give you back anything that was lost when
    you did a character delete.  This included everything, NOTHING
    will be given back.  Delete is delete, if you have a problem with
    this, post a reasonable argument on the complaints board (help
    gboard)
4.  You are not to ask for specific directions to a certain area.  If
    you want this, ask another player or start looking at hompages.
5.  Do not request us to up/lower a mob or make a certain type of item
    just for you.   If you feel we are lacking a certain type of item
    in the game, use the complaints or idea board.
6.  Don't ask for restrings (item renaming) unless you have restring
    tokens or have the proper glory for a restring.  The whole thing
    costs 1000 glory or 100 per line or 500 for anything over 4 lines
    of look descriptions
7.  Do not repeatively ask for quests, if you ask a lot we might silence
    you or refuse to do a quest for awhile.  Quests are done to allow
    you to have fun and get rare stuff, but we do it as an addition not
    something that is a MUST every day.
8.  Do NOT ask for a class change no MATTER how much time you have put
    into the mud, no matter what you have done for me, no matter
    ANYTHING.  I will not change your class or race even if you hand
    over a billion gold or QP points.  The first person to send me
    a $100 in American Money (cash, not a check) will get an avatar
    mage with no equipment *l*.

Allowed Requests:
1.  Corpse Retrievals if it was caused by a bug or you are a true newbie
2.  Ask about any new changes to the mud, but not details like where
    they are or how much it costs, or to ID it, or auction it, etc.
3.  You may ask for an UPLIFT ONLY if you are about to die.  I allow
    the immortals to uplift you a lot of the times if you are stunned,
    but this will change as we get more players online.

NOTE:  There might be additions later, and the rules for harassment still
exist here.  If we say no, we mean NO.  Repeative asking for a favor or
an answer can lead to a silence or worse.  Please be patient and kind if
you ask an Immortal for something.

#General Laws~

We are a no multiplaying mud.  This means you should not have more than
1 open connection to the mud at any given time.  Failure to follow this
rule will lead to warnings at first, and then freezing, banning, or anything
else we feel is warranted.

                 ___LANS___
If you are on a LAN and going to have multiple people playing on
the same network, you are to contact Xerves or any admin or staff ranking
immortal before logging more than 1 character.  Often we will watch you
to make sure you aren't multing characters through this LAN to get
around the 1 player limit.  If you are caught abusing our rules
on LANs, the whole LAN address will be banned from use.  Mainly,
if you are on a LAN, don't give out your password to other members
unless you trust them, if they try to log you on so they can use
4 characters and are caught, your LAN access will be denied and
maybe your character froze.

Pkilling is allowed, there are only a few rules and they are posted.  See

-1 'LAW OBJECTS'~
#General Laws~
#END~
As it comes down to it, the rule is possession is 10/10 of the law.  If you
leave an object laying around on the ground, it is open for anyone to pick it
up and take it.  If you give an object to a player to hold, it is now their
object and they have the right to keep this item if they so wish.  Be careful
who you trust because we will not sort out this mess.
~

1 'LAW PKILL'~
#General Laws~
#END~
Rafermand is considered an "open pkill" environment because everyone is
setup so they can pkill, there are no nonpkillers or pkillers.  However,
there are certain zones/rooms that are safe from pkill, and different
levels of pkill (Safe, Noloot, An Item, Fullloot).  It is important to
know the rules of pkill, and what you can do to avoid pkill if you want
to (however, it is hard when you get in higher levels).

Also, it is useful to know what kind of pkill room you are in, you can use
the command pstatus or put in the %p variable in your prompt.

With that, please read the following help files.

-1 'LAW REIMBURSEMENT'~
#General Laws~
#END~
Lately there has been some problems with reimbursement for crashes so
here are the rules for crashes and some tips.

First of all, SAVE often, I know crashes can be seen as my fault, but
things do happen and I am not perfect.  If you save often, you will
find yourself losing less during a crash.

Below is a list of things that will be reimbursed during a crash and
what will not.  If you don't see it on a list, please go ahead and
ask about the rules on it.  As for who to ask, ask anyone who is
staff level or higher to be reimbursed.  If no one is online, post a
note and we will tend to you as soon as possible.

Will be reimbursed...
1.  Special "quest" items that are lost during a crash.  Don't expect this
    to happen immediately because we will be checking to make sure you
    aren't cheating us.  If you are, you will be punished. (see below
    for instanced were it will not be given back)
2.  If your pfile is totally whacked up, we will put a new one in and
    will try to get you back any special quest items that were lost
    in between now and the last backup.  After that, we ask that you
    do any work you did to get yourself caught back up.
3.  In a freak accident or testing with an immortal, if something scraps
    it will typically be loaded up again for you.  If you are told no,
    don't harass the immortal, post a note to the complaint board or
    the complaint council.

What will not be reimbursed....
1.  Anything due to a DT even if it was a quest item.  Any time you hand
    something out, you take the risk of losing it.  If we find you are
    handing out special "quest" items to other people and it is lost during
    a crash, sorry, it won't be given back.  If it is your player, we will
    spend time investigating to see if it was truely "lost".
2.  Any minor item that you had.  If you have mithril equipment and lost a
    bunch of bronze stuff, go get off your lazy ass and go get it again
3.  WE WILL not give items out if you DT or lose an item, get it scrapped,
    disarmed, etc.  If you didn't lose it to a crash, no reimbursement.
4.  Skills will not be reimbursed unless it is said so by immortals.  This
    will only be the case if there was a bug or a mistake by an immortal.
5.  Gold sometimes will not be given back, if it is skill related, please
    consult an immortal due to many things can happen.
~

1 'LAW RESPONDING'~
#General Laws~
#END~
It is important that if an immortal asks you a question and if you
don't reply and asks you again that you reply to the immortal.  Trying
to avoid the immortal who is asking a question can get you punished by
maybe a silence or a helling or just a warning depending on the situation.

If the person asking is invis you are still to answer, but it might be
a good idea to ask if it is an immortal first.  If they say yes and we
find out later they were lying, the player will be dealt with for lying.
If all else fails, ask the one doing the talking to transfer you if you
don't beleive it is an immortal, that should be enough to prove it is
an immortal.

I find this law not to be a serious violation compared to others, but it
is just a law of respect, if an immortal asks, I am not saying you need to
jump up and say yes sir, no sir, just be kind and try to respond promptly.
~

-1 'LAW SHARING'~
#General Laws~
#END~
I discourage sharing of characters, and here is why.

1.  I have had people delete a shared pfile because they were pissed off at
    their friend at the time.
2.  Some how someone gets ahold of the password and strips everything off the
    character and gives it to another characters.  Probably a result of number
    1 or revenge of number 1.
3.  It confuses the immortals at times.  We like to know who is playing who.

When it comes to such things, ownership of the password is ownership of the
character.  If you let your friend use your character and he/she changes the
password on you, guess what, you are fucked and we won't do anythin
