Description         The project command was updated (as noted by this first project).  Please
look at (HELP PROJECT) for more information on how this command can
be used.  I would ask that you now please use it to report bugs/typos
and the sort.  If you wish to use the command to quickly record something
that is acceptable, but please don't use the gboards now that this
is now available.  Thanks

Description         This will be added in soon (probably by next week).  The following changes
will be coming your way.

1.  Some quest objects will be marked "minor" including all potions.  This
    will mean a minor object will be allowed to pop with another object that
    is not flagged minor.  Minor objects will mostly be potions/scrolls/repair
    and a few other catagories.
2.  Gold will start to load randomly on the ground.  There is a chance that instead
    of gold there might be an unique object (item loaded by a captain) or even slighter
    chance of a rare item (object loaded by a boss).
3.  Going to make all necklaces/cyan equipment load up affects.  There will be some other
    changes with higher end equipment (possible multiple effects, etc)
4.  Going to add new values to regular area objects that will allow them to be used in
    quests.

If you have any suggestions, leave a note on the subject.

Subject Area Objects Left~
Text Everything should be in besides the Area Object code where it would
pluck objects from areas.  Should see more cyan equipment and necklaces/
rings should always load up affects.

Will also see gold floating around on the ground along with a chance
of an object (mostly common sometimes unique).

Also minor objects (potions/scrolls/food/drink) will load a major
object if the minor object is loaded first.

This might be a bit quarky due to how it layers out.  If you have say an

a 0 wmod (no affect).  You will have to reequip the 80 wmod to get it to

Description         Know Enemy!
In my humble opinion, know enemy should be combined with 'eye of god', to some degree. I mean, every player has a race, and every race has a vulernability.
Shouldn't this be seen by know enemy? I think know enemy should also be 'farcastable'. Y'know, like you don't have to be in the same room as the target.
This would make sense to me, since a lot of mobs are aggressive right off the bat and know enemy seems to me like it's a pre-emptive spell that helps you decide how you want to handle fighting something.

Description         The idea is simple:  A spell, which would fit best as a teir 2 maybe 3 divine
that would cure most maluses (poison, weaken, blindness, curse).  Also
perhaps a tier 4(or 3 if the 1st is teir 2) divine spell that would cure all types
of problems(within reason), such as poison, curse, weaken, blindness, faeire fire,
unravel defense...etc.


The Bug:  Attack effects work even with the attacker misses, or is parried/blocked/dodged.
An example would be:  You feel very sick
A bloated corpse swings at you. (MISS)
Your muscles seem to atrophy.
You parry/dodge a monster's attack.


(Edit)  Some attack typos, such as when I miss, i get the message *She grunts, swings, and misses*,
but when a monster misses, i get the message "you grunt, swing and miss."  The messages are reversed.

monk weapons I know of are the hand weapons in Field of Combat.

Another possibility might be to base the damage of certain strike attacks on the
user's current weight and armor size. Could even reduce the damage dealt if the person isn't
skilled or strong enough to effectively strike while in heavier armor (don't need any newbie
monks running around in the heaviest gear without a little training.

into the code where it sends the "enters this world from within a column of blinding light!"
Just a minor fix that might help with those newbies who have absolutely no
idea what it is they're doing (or getting in to, this place would be scary as a first mud)

Description         When casting power drain or similar spells which transfer hp from the target to yourself, if you cast them at yourself you will actually increase your current hp.
It does not go over your maximum hp, and it does take mana, but it can be used almost like a minor healing spell. So, for myself, if I 'cast "power drain' radsris" I gain a few hp. Not much, of course, but the stronger spells would, I think, provide more

Description         I died on a quest, and went to the morgue to wait for my corpse to return. Eventually my quest ran out, and a corpse did appear, but it was Emeth's corpse, and did not contain my equipment.
All it contained was a vase of flowers. Morgue retrieve yes reported that 'No corpse could be found.' both before and after my quest ended.
I am not sure exactly what was in my corpse, but it was a gauntlet quest which I died on, with this character (Radsris). It contained some iron, steel and cobalt, a 'hoop of flowing water', a ring, a bag, and a backpack which was not worn, as well as any
quest keys that were still there, at least. Both the bag and the backpack contained items, including looted gems.

Subject Sorry, wasn't a bug~
Text The corpse turned up later. I probably wouldn't have projected this, except that there were no imms on, and the corpse appeared when the quest timer ran out.
Anyway, I had to leave, so I logged off, and when I logged back in, my corpse was there. It must have reappeared sometime later. Sorry about this.
